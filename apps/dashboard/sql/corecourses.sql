These tumors are named by their location in the body, cell of origin, rate of growth, and malignancy, if any. Some tumor types are more prevalent in children than in adults. Here is a listing of some common benign and malignant CNS tumors.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Glioma</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Glioma tumors grow from several types of glial cells. Glial cells support the function of neurons. Gliomas usually occur in the brain&rsquo;s cerebral hemispheres but may also strike other areas, especially the optic nerve, the brain stem and, particularly among children, the cerebellum. Gliomas are classified based on the type of normal glial cells they resemble.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Astrocytoma. About half of all CNS tumors are astrocytomas. They tumor cells resemble star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes and can be benign or malignant. Astrocytomas tend to form in the cerebrum in adults and in most parts of the brain in children. These tumors occur most often in middle-aged men. The most common forms of astrocytoma are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Anaplastic astrocytoma. Also called mid-grade astrocytomas, these tumors grow rapidly and invade other tissue. Treatment includes surgery followed by radiation and, sometimes, chemotherapy.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Pilocytic astrocytoma. These slow-growing tumors occur most often in children and young adults and rarely spread into surrounding tissue. They usually have well-defined borders and may be removed entirely by surgery.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Glioblastoma multiforme. These malignant, highly invasive tumors spread quickly and often recur following initial treatment. Also called grade IV astrocytoma, these tumors are often found in adults between the ages of 45 and 70 years. Doctors usually treat glioblastomas with surgery followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	Ependymoma. Ependymomas usually affect children and develop from cells that line the cavities of the brain and spinal canal where the CSF is made and stored. These tumors can also spread along the spinal canal. Most ependymomas are benign. Treatment usually includes surgery followed by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy is sometimes used, especially for recurrent tumors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Gangliogliomas. This very rare, slow-growing, benign tumor forms from nerve cells and glial cells. They can occur in the brain and the spine. Gangliogliomas can often be removed entirely by surgery. Radiation therapy may be needed if the entire tumor cannot be resected.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Oligodendrogliomas. These tumors, which resemble glial cells within the cerebral hemispheres that help insulate the nerve fibers that transmit nerve impulses, represent about 5 percent of all gliomas. Oligodendrogliomas occur most often in men ages 40-70 but can be found in children. Treatment usually involves surgery followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy for hard to reach tumors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Mixed gliomas contain more than one type of glial cell and are usually found in the cerebrum. They occur more frequently in adult men than women and can occur in children. These tumors can spread to other sites in the brain. Treatment focuses on the most malignant cell type found within the tumor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Other gliomas are named after the part of the body they affect. Among them are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Brain stem gliomas are found at the lowest part of the brain, which controls many vital body functions. They are most common in children and middle-aged adults. Surgery is not usually used to treat brain stem gliomas because of their vulnerable location. Radiation therapy sometimes helps to reduce symptoms and improve survival by slowing tumor growth.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Optic gliomas are found on or near the nerves that travel between the eye and brain vision centers and are particularly common in individuals who have neurofibromatosis. These tumors usually occur in children and adolescents. Treatment includes surgery or radiation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	Other childhood and adult CNS tumors include:</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Chordoma</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Chordomas are rare congenital tumors which develop from remnants of the flexible spine-like structure that forms and dissolves early in fetal development (and is later replaced by the bones of the spine). Chordomas often occur near the top or the bottom of the spine, outside the dura mater, and can invade the spinal canal and skull cavity. Most often seen in persons in their 50s or 60s, chordomas are usually treated by a combination of surgery and radiation.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Choroid Plexus Papilloma</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	This rare, usually benign childhood tumor develops slowly and can increase the production and block the flow of CSF, causing symptoms that include headaches and increased intracranial pressure. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove all or much of the tumor as possible. A rarer cancerous form that can spread via the cerebrospinal fluid is typically treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Craniopharyngioma</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Craniopharyngiomas, like chordomas, develop from cells left over from early fetal development. They often grow at the base of the brain, near the brain&#39;s pituitary gland (which releases chemicals important for the body&#39;s growth and metabolism), and may also affect the optic nerve and surrounding tissue. Craniopharyngiomas usually affect young children and adolescents. Treatment includes surgery and, in some patients, radiation therapy.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET)</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	This benign, slow-growing tumor is typically found in the top half of the brain. DNETs are seen most often in persons under age 20 but they can affect all ages. They are often diagnosed after a period of uncontrolled seizures, which can be treated surgically.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Germ Cell Tumors</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	These very rare childhood tumors may start in cells that fail to leave the CNS during development. Germ cell tumors usually form in the center of the brain, near the pineal gland, and can spread elsewhere in the brain and spinal cord. Different tumors are named after the type of germ cell and include teratomas (most common in newborns and infants), embryonic carcinomas, and germinomas. Depending on the tumor type, treatment involves radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of therapies.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Meningioma</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Meningiomas are tumors that develop from the thin membranes, or meninges, that cover the brain and spinal cord. These benign tumors account for more than 20 percent of all brain tumors and about 25 percent of all primary spinal cord tumors. They affect people of all ages, but are most common among those in their 40s. Meningiomas usually grow slowly, generally do not invade surrounding normal tissue, and rarely spread to other parts of the CNS or body. Surgery is the preferred treatment for accessible meningiomas.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Pineal Tumors</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Tumors that form in the pineal gland, a small structure located between the cerebellum and the cerebrum, account for about 1 percent of brain tumors. When possible, physicians will begin treatment with surgery or perform a biopsy to confirm the tumor type. They may also recommend radiation or chemotherapy, or both, for malignant pineal tumors. The three most common types of pineal region tumors are gliomas, germ cell tumors, and pineal cell tumors.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Pituitary Tumors (also called pituitary adenomas)</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	These small tumors form in the pituitary gland, which releases hormones that influence the body&#39;s growth, metabolism, and maturation. Most pituitary tumors are benign and their incidence increases with age. Pituitary tumors account for about 10 percent of all primary brain tumors. Doctors classify pituitary tumors into two groups&mdash;secreting and non-secreting. Secreting tumors release unusually high levels of pituitary hormones, which can trigger neurological conditions and symptoms including hyperthyroidism and Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome (the harmful over-production of the hormone cortisol). Treatment options include tumor resection, radiation therapy, and drug therapy.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (PNET)</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) usually affect children and young adults. These malignant tumors may spring from primitive or immature cells left over from early development of the nervous system. PNETS can spread throughout the brain and spinal cord in a scattered, patchy pattern and, in rare cases, cause cancer outside the CNS.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Doctors try to remove as much tumor as possible with surgery and follow up with radiation. Chemotherapy is used when the tumor affects the spinal canal or causes spinal cord compression. The two most common PNETs are medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Medulloblastomas, the most common PNET, represent more than 25 percent of all childhood brain tumors. They usually form in the cerebellum and can spread throughout the brain and along the spine. Most often these tumors are found in children under age 10.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Neuroblastomas account for up to 10 percent of childhood tumors. They generally appear above the adrenal glands but can be found in the brain and elsewhere in the body. Boys are slightly more at risk of developing these tumors than are girls.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Schwannomas</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	These benign tumors arise from the cells that form a protective sheath around the body&#39;s nerve fibers. They are usually benign and are surgically removed when possible. One of the more common forms of schwannoma affects the eighth cranial nerve, which contains nerve cells important for balance and hearing. Also known as vestibular schwannomas or acoustic neuromas, these tumors may grow on one or both sides of the brain.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Vascular Tumors</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	These rare, noncancerous tumors arise from the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord. The most common vascular tumor is the hemangioblastoma, which is linked in a small number of people to a genetic disorder called von Hippel-Lindau disease (see below). Hemangioblastomas do not usually spread, and doctors typically treat them with surgery.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Other Tumor-Related Conditions</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Arachnoid Cysts are benign, fluid-filled masses that form within a thin membrane lining (tumors are solid tissue masses). Cysts in the CNS can cause tumor-like symptoms including headache and seizures. Some cysts occur more often in the spinal cord than in the brain, and certain cysts are seen most frequently in children. Depending on their size and location, cysts may be monitored periodically for any change or treated surgically.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	CNS lymphoma occurs when cancerous cells which form in the lymph system (a part of the body&#39;s immune system) are present in the CNS. Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) begins in the brain; it affects a small number of otherwise healthy people and a larger fraction of those who have an impaired immune system, whether from organ transplants, infection with the AIDS virus, or other causes. Secondary brain lymphoma occurs when tumor cells from a lymphoma located outside the brain metastasize to the CNS. Doctors usually treat the disorder with chemotherapy or radiation. When the linings of the spinal canal are affected, chemotherapeutic drugs are either injected into the CSF either through a lumbar puncture needle or special equipment placed under the scalp that is connected to a tube that enters the normal CSF spaces (ventricles) within the brain.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Hydrocephalus involves the build-up of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. The excessive fluid can cause harmful pressure, headaches, and nausea. Treatment includes surgical insertion of a shunt that drains excess fluid to another area of the body, where it is absorbed as part of the circulatory process, or surgical treatment without a shunt to restore CSF circulation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Meningeal carcinomatosis is caused by cancer cells that metastasize to the CNS and spread around the brain and spinal cord via the cerebrospinal fluid. These cells can form colonies or small tumors in many places, including the roots of nerves, the surface of the brain, the cerebrum, the brain stem, and the spinal cord. Treatment includes radiation, which can sometimes slow growth of the cells, and chemotherapy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Neurofibromatosis refers to related genetic disorders that cause tumors to grow around nerves. Most tumors are benign but can become malignant over time. The more common form of this disorder, neurofibromatosis type 1, usually causes tumors in nerves outside the CNS and affects the skin and bones. Neurofibromatosis type 2 causes multiple CNS tumors that typically affect the nerve involved with hearing. Treatment may include surgery and radiation therapy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Pseudotumor cerebri, also called &ldquo;false brain tumor,&rdquo; mimics brain tumor symptoms and may be caused by the abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid. It is diagnosed by ruling out all other possible causes for symptoms and confirming that the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is increased. Pseudotumor cerebri is most common in women ages 20 to 50 years and can cause progressive visual loss in some patients if left alone. Treatment may include drugs to relieve pressure and shunting to drain the fluid to another area of the body.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that causes numerous neurological and physical symptoms, including seizures and benign tumors of eyes and CNS. It may be present at birth or develop over time. About half of those patients who have tuberous sclerosis develop benign astrocytomas. Treatment may include drug therapy and regular monitoring by a doctor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare, genetic multi-system disorder characterized by tumors that grow in certain parts of the body. Slow-growing benign tumors called hemangioblastomas (cyst-like masses of tangled blood vessels) may develop in the brain and nervous system. Treatment usually involves surgical resection of the tumor.</p>\r\n', 0, 1),
