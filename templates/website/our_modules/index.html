					<p>HHLEARN's primary mission is to provide high-quality employee training to
						homecare nursing, hospices, home medical equipment providers, and
						pharmacies. Our subscribers have asked us to create extra modules that
						can assist them in handling other aspects of managing and training
						employees. The following is a brief summary of the modules we have
						developed. We also encourage our loyal subscribers to provide us with
						other ideas that can help provide solutions for organizations.

							<h3>EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK
								<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}website/common/img/new.png" alt="New">
							</h3>

						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>HHLEARN's Employee Handbook Module (EHM) is designed to
								produce a customized employee
								handbook for each organization. Our EHM asks a series of
								questions and stores your specific
								data. The EHM then uses the stored data to prepare a
								custom employee handbook in Microsoft
								Word or Portable Document Format (PDF). What makes
								HHLEARN's Employee Handbook Module so
								unique is that a specific version is created for each
								state-specific location, so if you
								have locations in different states, a concise version
								will be created for each location and
								not one bloated version. HHLEARN also stores every
								version of your employee handbook so your
								organization has an audit trail.</p>

							<h3>INSERVICE TRACKER </h3>

						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>Every organization provides inservice education, and keeping
								track of this information is
								difficult. Our Inservice Tracking Module (ITM) allows
								you to automatically select the
								employees that attend each inservice and upload
								supporting documents that pertain to the
								inservice, e.g., ; files, ; files, PDFs, etc. These
								files then can be downloaded when needed
								to support the education topic. In addition, our ITM
								stores the attended inservices so they
								can be seen along with each employee's HHLEARN education
								history. Organizations can also
								print out professionally designed inservice rosters to
								be printed for hardcopy records (the
								non-green approach).</p>

							<h3>EVENT TRACKER</h3>

						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>Our Event Tracking Module (ETM) allows organizations to setup
								events that the organization
								needs to be alerted about. The system comes with a
								preloaded list of events, but each
								organization can load their own events and have email or
								text (SMS) messages sent to any
								employee. These events can be setup as one-time events
								or recurring at almost any frequency.
								All events are stored and the acknowledgments of these
								events are also stored for audit
								purposes.</p>
