									</ol>
									<p>Upon receipt of such notification, Dynamic or the Designated Agent will remove or disable access to such material and give notice of a claim of copyright infringement to the user or subscriber who authored the claimed infringing content by means of any one or more of the following methods at Dynamic's sole option: a general notice on the Sites, electronic mail to the content provider's email address in our records, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to such user's postal address in our records.</p>

									<b><p>Representations; Registration Data; Account Security</p></b>
									<p>In consideration of your use of any of the Sites, the Site Materials and the Services, you represent you are of legal age (and if for an organization, have the Authority) to form a binding contract. In consideration of your use of any of the Sites, the Site Materials and Services, you agree to:</p>
									<ol type="a">
									<li>provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Sites ("Registration Data");
									<li>maintain and be solely responsible for the security of your password and identification;
									<li>maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to Dynamic, to keep it accurate, current and complete; and
									<li>accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Registration Data and any other information you provide to Dynamic.
									</ol>
									<b><p>Submissions Relating to Site(s) or Services</p></b>
									<p>You acknowledge and agree that any materials, including but not limited to questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, plans, notes, drawings, original or creative materials, images or other information regarding the Sites, the Site Materials the Services or Dynamic provided by you by participating in surveys hosted by Dynamic, or any third party vendors, on the Sites or other sites, in the form of email, or any other submissions to Dynamic, or any postings on the Sites, are non-confidential and shall be the sole property of Dynamic, and that upon submission of such materials to Dynamic you thereby assign without additional consideration all right, title or interest you may hold in such materials to Dynamic. Dynamic shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these materials for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.</p>
									<b><p>Payments</p></b>
									<p>You agree to pay the monthly fee for the subscribed users on the Site. The monthly payment is required at the beginning of each month (or thirty-day period). Forms of payment HHLEARN accepts are most major credit cards, electronic debit of bank account, or via check. There will be an additional three (3%) surcharge for the use of credit cards; there is no extra surcharge for the use of electronic debiting of a bank account or checks. Subscribers may pay multiple months in advance.</p> 
									<p>There is no grace period for non-payment. If a monthly charge does not clear, the subscriber's account will immediately become inaccessible. Any charges incurred by HHLEARN processing insufficient funds will be the sole responsibility of the subscriber to remunerate back to HHLEARN.</p>
									<b><p>Number of Users</p></b>
									<p>HHLEARN is a subscription service that utilizes a monthly fee for a designated range of users. If the subscriber attempts to load more than their paid user allotment, the difference between the next higher rate and the current rate will be charged before the subscriber will be allowed to load additional users. There will be notifications that must be agreed to before additional charges and users will be allowed on the Site. Only users of the Site that have administrator privileges will be allowed to authorize additional users/charges. If a subscriber falls under their allotment of users, e.g., the next lower level, there will be no proration for the current period and the lower fee will automatically start on the next monthly period.</p>
									<p>HHLEARN does not allow the manipulation of active users, i.e., turning users on and off, to keep the subscriber's organization under their user allotment. When a user is turned off (deactivated), they are deactivated. Deactivated users can be reactivated, but a fee equal to the user's prorated monthly fee will be charged for each monthly period of deactivation. An example would be having 10 users on the system and a monthly fee of $30. If a deactivated user is reactivated, their prorated monthly charge of $3 (30 ÷ 10) would be charged for each month of deactivation. In this example, the user was deactivated for 3 months; a fee of $9 would be charged (in addition to the normal monthly subscription fee) to reactivate the user.</p>
									<b><p>Free or Trial Periods</p></b>
									<p>If a subscriber has been granted a free or trial period, the Site will have limitations (e.g., sample completion certificates, limited support, etc.). The sample-watermarked certificates will only appear during this free or trial period. Once the subscriber has converted to a paying account, the watermarked certificates will be cleared. The type and quantity of limitations may change over time and HHLEARN has no obligation to inform the subscriber of these limitations.</p>
									<b><p>Indemnification</p></b>
									<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless HHLEARN and Dynamic, their affiliated entities, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Sites, the Site Materials, the Services and any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Sites, the Services, including without limitation, any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim made against HHLEARN or Dynamic and/or their affiliated entities, independent contractors, licensors, service providers, employees, directors or consultants, arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms of Use, the Google Admin Policies or the Privacy Policy, as each may be amended from time to time, or your violation of any law(s), regulation(s), or the right(s) of any third party.</p>
