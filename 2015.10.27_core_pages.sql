It’s easy to become overwhelmed by a new world of tests, technology, and treatments that your patients may know little or nothing about. This course will provide you with a better understanding of brain and spinal cord tumors, their treatment options, and the latest research to find safer, more effective ways to diagnose and treat them. You can take the best care of your patients by learning about their diagnosis and being able to discuss with them the signs, symptoms, and range of emotions they may be going through.</p>\r\n\r\n{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\n\r\n<h1>Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors</h1>\n\r\n<p>Brain and spinal cord tumors are found in the tissue inside the skull or the bony spinal column, which makes up the central nervous system (CNS). A tumor is a mass of cells that forms a new growth or is present at birth (congenital). Tumors occur when genes that regulate cell growth become damaged or mutated, allowing cells to grow and divide out of control. Tumors can form <i>anywhere</i> in the body.</p>\n\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:112}}</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the type, a growing tumor can kill healthy cells or disrupt their function. It can move or press on sensitive tissue and block the flow of blood and other fluid, causing pain and inflammation.  A tumor can also block the normal flow of electricity in the brain or nerve signaling to and from the brain. Some tumors cause no trouble at all.\rThere are more than 120 types of brain and spinal cord tumors. Some are named by the type of cell in which they start (such as glioma) or location (such as meningioma, which form in the lining of the brain and spinal cord). See the Appendix (<i class="fa fa-folder-open-o"></i>) in the course toolbar for a listing of some CNS tumors and tumor-related conditions.</p>', 1, 144, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(2, 'ds-d43_02', '<h1>Overview of the Brain and Spinal Cord</h1><p>The brain has three major parts:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ol>\n<li><b>Brain stem:</b> This lowest part of the brain (above the neck) connects to the spinal cord and relays information between the brain and the body using bundles of long nerves. It controls basic life-sustaining functions including blood pressure, heartbeat, breathing, consciousness, swallowing, and body temperature;</li>\n<li><b>Cerebrum:</b> This largest and outermost part of the brain processes information from our senses to tell the body how to respond.  It controls functions including movement, touch, judgment, learning, speech, emotions, and thinking; and</li>\n<li><b>Cerebellum:</b> Located at the lower rear of the brain, above the brain stem, the cerebellum controls balance, helps maintain equilibrium, and coordinates complex muscle movements such as walking and talking.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<p>The brain’s two halves, or hemispheres, use nerve cells (neurons) to speak with each other. Each side of the cerebrum controls movement and function <i>on the other side of the body</i>. In addition, each hemisphere has <i>four</i> sections, called lobes, which handle different neurological functions.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:113}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{COURSE_IMAGE:114}}</p>\n\n<p>The frontal lobes manage voluntary movement, such as writing, and let us set and prioritize goals. A frontal lobe tumor can cause changes in personality, intellect, reasoning and behavior, affect coordination and walking, and cause speech loss. The temporal lobes are linked to perception, memory, and understanding sounds and words. A tumor here might cause speech and hearing problems, blackouts, seizures, or sensations such as a feeling of fear. The parietal lobes let us simultaneously receive and understand sensations such as pressure and pain. A parietal lobe tumor might cause difficulty understanding or speaking words, problems with coordination, seizures, and numbness or weakness on one side of the body. The occipital lobes receive and process light and visual images and detect motion. An occipital lobe tumor can affect the field of vision, usually on one side of the face, and how we understand written words.</p>\n\n<p><i>Three</i> layers of protective tissue (called the meninges) cover the brain and spinal cord:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-green">\n<ol>\n<li>The thick <em><b>dura mater</b></em> (outer layer);</li>\n<li>The <em><b>arachnoid</b></em> (middle); and</li>\n<li>The <em><b>pia mater</b></em> (innermost to the brain).</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:113}}</p>\n\n<p>Brain tumors in infants and adults tend to be located in the cerebrum. Brain tumors in children ages 1-12 years are more commonly found in the cerebellum.</p>\n\n<p>The spinal cord, an extension of the brain, lies protected inside the bony spinal column. It contains bundles of nerves that carry messages between the brain and other parts of the body such as instructions from the brain to move an arm or information from the skin that signals pain.</p>\n\n<p>A tumor that forms on or near the spinal cord can disrupt communication between the brain and the nerves or restrict the cord\'s supply of blood. Because the spinal column is narrow, a tumor here, unlike a brain tumor, can cause symptoms on both sides of the body at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Most spinal cord tumors form below the neck. Symptoms generally strike body areas at the same level or at a level below that of the tumor. For example, a tumor midway along the spinal cord (in the thoracic spine) can cause pain that spreads over the chest and gets worse when the individual coughs, sneezes, or lies down. A tumor that grows in the cervical spine can cause pain that seems to come from the neck or arms, and a tumor that grows in the lower, lumbar spine can trigger back or leg pain.</p>\n\n<p>The three major groups of spinal cord tumor describe where they are found. Extradural tumors grow between the inner surface of the spinal canal and the tough dura mater. Tumors inside the dura (intradural tumors) are further divided into those outside the spinal cord (extramedullary tumors) and those inside the spinal cord (intramedullary tumors). Other descriptors for spinal cord tumors are intrinsic, meaning the tumor forms inside the spinal cord, and extrinsic, where the tumor forms outside of and presses on the cord as it grows.</p>', 2, 277, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(3, 'ds-d43_03', '<h1>Benign and Malignant Tumors</h1><p>No matter where they are located in the body, tumors are classified as <i>benign</i> or <i>malignant</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Benign tumors are slow growing, non-cancerous cell masses that have a defined edge and do not spread to other parts of the body. Cells in the tumor are similar to normal cells. Often these tumors can be removed surgically and usually do not recur.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:116}}</p>\n\n\n<p>Malignant, or cancerous, tumors have cells that look different from normal cells. They can quickly invade surrounding tissue and often have edges that are hard to define, which makes it difficult to remove the entire tumor surgically.</p>\n\n<h1>Primary and Metastatic Tumors</h1>\n<p><i>Primary tumors</i> of the CNS are growths that begin in the brain or spinal cord. They can be either malignant or benign and are identified by the types of cells they contain, their location, or both. Most primary CNS tumors occur in adults.</p>\n\n<p>Metastatic, or <i>secondary</i>, tumors in the CNS are caused by cancer cells that break away from the primary tumor that developed in a non-CNS part of the body. These tumors are named after the type of cancer that causes them.   Metastastic tumors (also called metastases) to the brain occur in about one-fourth of all cancers that develop in other parts of the body such as cancer of the lung, breast, or kidneys; or melanoma, a form of skin cancer. They are more common than primary tumors and occur more often in adults than in children.</p>\n\n<p>Metastatic spine tumors usually form within the bony covering of the spinal column, but may also invade the spinal canal from the chest or abdomen. While cancers elsewhere in the body can easily cause tumors inside the brain and spinal cord, CNS tumors rarely spread outside the nervous system.</p>\n\n<h1>Causes of CNS Tumors</h1>\n<p>Researchers really don\'t know why primary brain and spinal cord tumors develop.  Possible causes under investigation include viruses, defective genes, exposure to certain chemicals and other hazardous materials, and immune system disorders. Although smoking, alcohol consumption, and certain dietary habits are associated with some types of cancers, they have not been linked to primary CNS tumors.</p>\n\n<p>In a small number of individuals, CNS tumors may result from specific genetic diseases such as neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis, or exposure to radiation. It is currently unclear if non-ionizing radiation (radio waves) from mobile phone use increases the risk of developing a brain tumor.<sup>1</sup>  Brain and spinal cord tumors are <u>not</u> contagious or, at this time, preventable.</p>\n\n<div class="footnote footnote-gray"><h4>Footnote:</h4><sup>1</sup> Carcinogenicity of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.

	(4, 'ds-d43_04', '<h1>CNS Tumor Risk</h1><p>Anyone can develop a primary CNS tumor, although the risk is very small. Having one or more of the known risk factors does not guarantee that someone will develop a tumor. Brain tumors occur more often in males than in females and are most common in middle-aged to older persons. They also tend to occur more often in children under age 9 than in other children, and some tumors tend to run in families. Most brain tumors in children are primary tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Other risk factors for developing a primary CNS tumor include race (Caucasians are more likely to develop a CNS tumor than other races) and occupation. Workers in jobs that require repeated contact with ionizing radiation or certain chemicals, including those used to manufacture building supplies or plastics and textiles, have a greater chance of developing a brain tumor.</p>\n\n<h1>Incidence of CNS Tumors</h1>\n\n<p>More than 359,000 persons in the United States are estimated to be living with a diagnosis of primary brain or central nervous system tumor.<sup>2</sup> More than 195,000 Americans are diagnosed with a brain tumor each year.<sup>3</sup>  Brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumor in children.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:117}}</p>\n\n<p>Spinal cord tumors are less common than brain tumors. Although they affect people of all ages, spinal cord tumors are most common in young and middle-aged adults. Nearly 3,200 central nervous system tumors are diagnosed each year in children under age 20.<sup>4</sup></p>\n\n<h1>Categorizing Tumors</h1>\n\n<p>The generally accepted scale for grading CNS tumors was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993. Grading is based on the tumor’s cellular makeup and location. Tumors may also be classified as low-grade (slowly growing) or high-grade (rapidly growing). Some tumors change grades as they progress, usually to a higher grade, and can become a different type of tumor. The tumor is graded by a pathologist following a biopsy or during surgery.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\n<li><em><b>Grade I</b></em> tumors grow slowly and generally do not spread to other parts of the brain. It is often possible to surgically remove an entire grade I benign tumor, but this type of tumor may be monitored periodically, without further treatment.\n<li><em><b>Grade II</b></em> tumors also grow slowly, sometimes into surrounding tissue, and can become a higher-grade tumor.  Treatment varies according to tumor location and may require chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery followed by close observation.\n<li><em><b>Grade III</b></em> tumors are malignant and can spread quickly into other CNS tissue. Tumor cells will look different than those in surrounding tissue. Aggressive treatment, often using a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery, is required.\n<li><em><b>Grade IV</b></em> tumors invade nearby tissue very quickly and are difficult to treat. The cancerous tissue will look very different from surrounding tissue.

Common symptoms of a brain tumor in adults include headaches, seizures, problems with balance or coordination, loss of muscle control, hydrocephalus, and changes in personality or behavior.</p>\n\n<p><i>Headaches are the most common symptom of a brain tumor</i>. Headaches may progressively worsen, become more frequent or constant, and recur, often at irregular intervals. Headache pain may worsen when coughing, changing posture, or straining and may be severe upon waking.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:118}}</p>\n\n<p>Seizures can occur with symptoms that may include convulsions, loss of consciousness, or loss of bladder control. Seizures that first start in adulthood (in someone who has not been in an accident or who had an illness that causes seizures) are a key warning sign of brain tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Nausea and vomiting may be more severe in the morning and may accompany headaches. Vision or hearing problems can include blurred or double vision, partial or total loss of vision or hearing, ringing or buzzing sounds, and abnormal eye movements.</p>\n\n<p>Personality, behavior, and cognitive changes can include psychotic episodes and problems with speech, language, thinking, and memory. Motor problems can include weakness or paralysis, lack of coordination, or gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or leg. A sudden, marked change in handwriting may be a sign of a tumor.</p>\n\n<p>Balance problems can include dizziness, trouble with walking, clumsiness, or loss of the normal control of equilibrium. Hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure are caused when a tumor blocks the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms may include headaches, nausea, and vomiting.</p>\n\n<p>Other symptoms may include endocrine disorders or abnormal hormonal regulation, difficulty swallowing, facial paralysis and sagging eyelid, fatigue, weakened sense of smell, or disrupted sleep and sleep pattern changes.</p>\n\n<p>Common symptoms of a spinal cord tumor include pain, numbness or sensory changes, and motor problems and loss of muscle control. Pain can feel as if it is coming from various parts of the body. Back pain may extend to the hips, legs, feet, and arms. This pain is often constant and may be severe. It is often progressive and can have a burning or aching quality.</p>\n\n<p>Numbness or sensory changes can include decreased skin sensitivity to temperature and progressive numbness or a loss of sensation, particularly in the legs. Motor problems and loss of muscle control can include muscle weakness, spasticity (in which the muscles stay stiffly contracted), and impaired bladder and/or bowel control. If untreated, symptoms may worsen to include muscle wasting, decreased muscle strength, an abnormal walking rhythm known as ataxia, and paralysis.</p>\n\n<p>Symptoms may spread over various parts of the body when one or more tumors extend over several sections of the spinal cord.</p>', 5, 222, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(6, 'ds-d43_06', '<h1>Diagnosing CNS Tumors</h1><p>A doctor, usually a neurologist, oncologist, or neuro-oncologist, can confirm a diagnosis of a brain or spinal cord tumor based on a patient’s symptoms, personal and family medical history, and results of a physical exam and specialized tests and techniques.</p>\n\n<p>A neurological exam, the first test, assesses movement and sensory skills, hearing and speech, reflexes, vision, coordination and balance, mental status, and changes in mood or behavior, among other abilities. Some tests require a specialist to perform and analyze results.</p>\n\n<h2>Diagnostic Imaging</h2>\n\n<p>The physician will order one or more imaging techniques that show extremely detailed views of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves.  If there is a tumor, diagnostic imaging will confirm the diagnosis and help doctors determine the tumor\'s type, detect swelling and other associated conditions, and, over time, check the results of treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Computed Tomography (CT) uses x-rays and a computer to produce fast, detailed cross-sectional images or “slices” of organs, bones, and tissues, including a tumor. It is also good for detecting the buildup of calcium, which causes tissue to harden and can develop into a tumor.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:119}}</p>\n\n<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses a computer, radio waves, and a strong magnetic field to produce two-dimensional slices or a detailed three-dimensional model of tissue being scanned. MRI takes longer to perform than does a CT but is more sensitive and gives better pictures of tumors located near bone.</p>\n\n<p>Both CT and MRI scans for tumors are usually performed before and after administration of a "contrast" agent (such as a dye) that is given into a vein. Many tumors become much brighter on the scan taken after the contrast is given.</p>\n\n<p>Functional MRI (fMRI) creates images of areas of the brain with specific functions such as movement and language. It can assess brain damage from head injury or degenerative disorders, identify and monitor other neurological disorders such as stroke, and show the distance between specific brain functions and tumors in particular areas of the brain.</p>\n\n<p>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) gives doctors a chemical snapshot of tissues being studied. It uses the MRI scanner\'s magnetic field and radio waves to measure and analyze the chemical make-up of the tissue sample.</p>\n\n<p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides computer-generated two- and three-dimensional scans of the brain’s chemical activity and cellular function. PET traces and measures the brain’s use of glucose (sugar used by the brain for energy) that is attached to small amounts of radioactivity and injected into the bloodstream. Since malignant tissue uses more glucose than normal tissue, it usually shows up on the scan as brighter than surrounding tissue.</p>\n\n<p>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies blood flow to tissue. Certain tumors grow new blood vessels to increase their supply of blood and nutrients. A radioactive isotope is injected intravenously and traced as it travels into the skull. A sophisticated computer processes and stacks the data into a detailed three-dimensional image of activity within the brain.</p>\n\n<p>Angiography (or arteriogram) can distinguish certain types of tumors that have a characteristic pattern of blood vessels and blood flow. A dye that deflects x-rays is injected into a major blood vessel and a series of x-rays are taken as the dye flows to the brain. In many situations, angiography has been replaced by non-invasive tests such as CT and MRI.</p>', 6, 241, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(7, 'ds-d43_07', '<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2><p>	Testing blood, urine, and other substances can provide clues about the tumor and monitor levels of therapeutic drugs. Additional tests may include an electroencephalogram, or EEG, which monitors brain activity through the skull (tumors can disrupt the normal flow of brain wave activity and cause seizures); CSF analysis in which a small amount of the cerebrospinal fluid is removed by a special needle and examined for abnormal cells or unusual levels of various compounds that suggest a brain or spinal cord tumor; and magnetoencephalography (MEG) which studies brain function by measuring the magnetic field generated by nerve cells in the brain. CSF fluid analysis should be performed with extreme caution on individuals with very large brain tumors.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:261}}</p>\n\n<p>Diagnosing the distinct type of brain tumor is often difficult.

	(8, 'ds-d43_09', '<h2>Radiation Therapy</h2><p>Radiation therapy usually involves repeated doses of x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from multiplying. When successful, this therapy shrinks the tumor mass but does not actually remove it. Radiation therapy can be used to treat surgically inaccessible tumors or tumor cells that may remain following surgery.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on tumor type and stage, radiation treatment might be delivered externally, using focused beams of energy or charged particles that are directed at the tumor, or internally, using a surgically implanted device. The stronger the radiation the deeper it can penetrate to the target site. Healthy cells may also be damaged by radiation therapy but most are able to repair themselves, while the damaged tumor cells cannot.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:121}}</p>\n\n<p>A radiation oncologist will explain the therapy and how much radiation is needed. Treatment often begins a week after surgery and may continue for several weeks. Depending on tumor type and location, individuals may be able to receive a modified form of therapy to lessen damage to healthy cells and improve the overall treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Externally delivered radiation therapy poses no risk of radioactivity to the patient or family and friends. Types of external radiation therapy include:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\n<li><em>Whole brain radiation</em> is generally used to shrink multiple cancerous tumors rather than to target individual tumors. It may be given as the sole form of treatment or in advance of other forms of radiation therapy and microsurgery.  Whole brain radiation is generally used for metastatic tumors and rarely for primary tumors.\n<li><em>Conventional external beam radiation</em> aims a uniform dose of high-energy radiation at the tumor and surrounding tissue from outside the body. It is used to treat large tumors or those that may have spread into surrounding tissue.\n<li><em>Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy</em> (3D-CRT) uses diagnostic imaging to prepare an accurate, computer-generated three-dimensional image of the tumor and surrounding tissue. The computer then coordinates and sends multiple beams of radiation to the tumor’s exact shape, sparing nearby organs and surrounding tissue.\n<li><em>Intensity modulated radiation therapy</em> (IMRT) is similar to 3D-CRT, but varies the intensity of the hundreds of individual radiation beams to deliver more precise doses to the tumor or to specific areas within it. IRMT can provide a highly effective dose of radiation to the tumor, with less exposure to surrounding tissue.\n<li><em>Hyperfractionation</em> involves giving two or more smaller amounts of radiation a day instead of a larger, single dose.  It can deliver more radiation to certain tumors and reduce damage to normal cells.\n<li><em>Radiosurgery</em> is usually a one-time treatment involving a large amount of sharply focused radiation that is aimed at the brain tumor. <b>Stereotactic radiosurgery</b> uses computer imaging to direct precisely focused radiation into the tumor from multiple angles. It does not actually cut into the person but, like other forms of radiation therapy, harms a tumor cell’s ability to grow and divide. Stereotactic radiosurgery is commonly used to treat surgically inaccessible tumors. It also may be used at the end of conventional radiation treatment. Two common stereotactic procedures are:\n	<ul>\n<li><em>Linear-accelerated radiosurgery</em> (LINAC), which uses radar-like technology to prepare and fire a single beam of high-energy x-rays into the tumor. Also called high linear-energy transfer radiation, LINAC forms the beam to match the tumor’s shape, avoiding surrounding tissue. A special machine that rotates around the head then fires a uniform dose of radiation into the tumor.\n<li><em>Gamma knife® radiosurgery</em> focuses more than 200 beams of gamma radiation into one intersecting beam that is fired into the tumor. It also uses computer imaging to prepare a model of the tumor. This single treatment takes between one and four hours and is often recommended for inaccessible or hard to treat tumors.<br /><br />Both procedures may be given on an outpatient basis but an overnight stay in the hospital is often recommended.<br /><br /></li>\n	</ul>\n<li><em>Proton beam therapy</em> directs a beam of high-energy protons directly at the tumor site, leaving surrounding healthy tissue and organs intact. It is best used to treat tumors that are solid and have not spread to other parts of the body. Proton beam therapy can be used as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with chemotherapy or as follow-up to surgery.\n<li><em>Internal tumor radiation therapy</em>, also called brachytherapy or interstitial radiation therapy, involves placing a small amount of radioactive material into or near the tumor (or its cavity, if the tumor has been surgically removed).  In most cases, the radiation is inserted at the time of surgery or using imaging and a catheter. The radiation may be left in place for several days and, if more than one treatment is needed, the doctor may leave the catheter in place for a longer period.<br /><br />Individuals may need to be hospitalized for a few days following this procedure as the radiation may extend outside their body and could possibly harm others. The radiation becomes less active each day until it is safe for individuals who have been treated to be around others.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Side effects of radiation therapy vary from person to person and are usually temporary. They typically begin about two weeks after treatment starts and may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, reddened or sore skin in the area receiving treatment, headache, hearing loss, problems with sleep, and hair loss (although the hair usually grows back once the treatment has stopped). Radiation therapy in young children, particularly those children age three or younger, can cause problems with learning, processing information, thinking, and growing.</p>', 9, 372, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(9, 'ds-d43_10', '<h2>Chemotherapy</h2><p>Chemotherapy uses powerful drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing or dividing. These drugs are usually given by pill or injection and travel through the body to the brain, or can be inserted surgically using dissolvable wafers that have been soaked in a chemotherapeutic drug. These wafers slowly release a high concentrate of the drug to kill any remaining malignant cells. Chemotherapy may also be given to kill cancer cells in the spinal column.</p>\n\n<p>Chemotherapy is given in cycles to more effectively harm cancer cells and give normal cells time to recover from any damage. The oncologist will base the treatment on the type of cancer, drug(s) to be used, the frequency of administration, and the number of cycles needed.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:122}}</p>\n\n<p>Individuals might receive chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery (called neoadjuvant therapy), in combination with radiation therapy, or after radiation treatment (called adjuvant therapy) to destroy any remaining cancer cells. Metronomic therapy involves giving continuous low-dose chemotherapy to block mechanisms that stimulate the growth of new blood vessels needed to feed the tumor. Chemotherapy is also used to treat CNS lymphoma and inaccessible tumors or tumors that do not respond to radiation therapy.</p>\n\n<p>Not all tumors are vulnerable to the same anticancer drugs, so a person’s treatment may include a combination of drugs. Common CNS chemotherapeutics include temozolomide, carmustine (also called BCNU), lomustine, tamoxifen, carboplatin, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine. Individuals should be sure to discuss all options with their medical team.</p>\n\n<p>Side effects of chemotherapy may include hair loss, nausea, digestive problems, reduced bone marrow production, and fatigue. The treatment can also harm normal cells that are growing or dividing at the same time, but these cells usually recover and problems stop once the treatment has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Alternative and complementary approaches may help tumor patients better cope with their diagnosis and treatment.  Some of these therapies, however, may be harmful if used during or after cancer treatment and should be discussed with a doctor beforehand. Common approaches include nutritional and herbal supplements, vitamins, special diet, and mental or physical techniques to reduce stress.</p>\n\n<h1>Prognosis</h1>\n\n<p>Each person is different. Prognosis depends greatly on prompt diagnosis and treatment, the individual’s age and general health, whether the tumor is malignant or benign, tumor size and location, tumor grade, and response to therapy. An individual whose entire tumor has been removed successfully may recover completely. Generally, <i>prognosis is poorer in very young children and in older individuals</i>. Rehabilitation and counseling can help patients and family members better cope with the disorder and improve quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>Continued monitoring and long-term follow-up is advised as many tumors resist treatment and tend to recur.</p>\n\n<p>Normal tissue and nerves that may have been damaged or traumatized by the tumor or its treatment will need time to heal.

Several of today’s treatment regimens were experimental therapies only a decade ago. Current clinical studies of genetic risk factors, environmental causes, and molecular mechanisms of cancers may translate into tomorrow’s treatment of, or perhaps cure for, these tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Much of this work is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the collaborative efforts of its National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and National Cancer Institute (NCI), as well as other agencies within the Federal government, nonprofit groups, pharmaceutical companies, and private institutions. Some of this research is conducted through the collaborative neuroscience and cancer research community at the NIH or through research grants to academic centers throughout the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The jointly sponsored NCI-NINDS Neuro-Oncology Branch coordinates research to develop and test the effectiveness and safety of innovative therapies for people with CNS tumors. These experimental treatment options may include new drugs, combination therapy, gene therapy, biologic immuno-agents, surgery, and radiation. Information about these trials, and trials involving other disorders, can be accessed at the Federal government’s database of clinical trials, http://clinicaltrials.gov.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:123}}</p>\n\n<p>Part of this research involves creating a comprehensive public database of clinical, molecular, and genetic information on brain tumors to help researchers and clinicians identify and evaluate molecular targets in brain cancer. The joint NCI-NINDS Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) will hold genetic and molecular analysis of samples from brain tumor patients in NCI-sponsored clinical trials in what is slated to become the largest clinical/genetic corollary study ever conducted on brain tumors. It will also store a wide array of molecular and genetic data regarding all types of brain tumors. Understanding the biology behind these tumors will provide clues to new therapeutic approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers are also developing mouse models that mimic human CNS cancers, which may speed discovery of potential treatments in humans.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond their efforts to develop needed resources, scientists at the NIH and at universities across the US are exploring a variety of approaches to treat CNS tumors. These experimental approaches include boosting the immune system to better fight tumor cells, developing therapies that target the tumor cell while sparing normal cells, making improvements in radiation therapy, disabling the tumor using genes attached to viruses, and defining biomarkers that may predict the response of a CNS tumor to a particular treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Biological therapy involves enhancing the body’s overall immune response to recognize and fight cancer cells. The immune system is designed to attack foreign substances in the body. Since cancer cells aren’t foreign, they usually do not generate much of an immune response. Researchers are using different methods to provoke a strong immune response to tumor cells. Such proteins as interleukin and interferon, both of which are immune system “messengers” called cytokines, and other substances can stimulate and restore the body’s natural response against proteins on the surfaces of cancer cells and thus slow tumor growth. Other therapy uses viruses, T-cells (a major component of immune system function), and other substances to increase immune response and target the tumor cells. Scientists are also experimenting with genetically altered T-cells from the patient’s own body which are cultured with an antigen and injected directly into the brain following surgery. Biological therapies to fight CNS tumors include vaccines, gene therapy, antibody therapy, and tumor growth factors.</p>', 11, 257, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(11, 'ds-d43_12', '<h1>Clinical Research Studies (Cont.)</h1><p>Antibodies are proteins that are normally produced by the body to ward off bacteria and viruses. Monoclonal antibodies are multiple copies of a single antibody that act as a homing device to fit one—and only one—type of antigen (a protein on the surface of the tumor cell that stimulates the immune system response). Scientists at the NINDS and elsewhere are linking these antibodies to immunotoxins that seek out tumor cells with a matching antigen, bind to these tumor cells, and deliver their toxin with minimal damage to surrounding normal cells. Additional approaches include attaching a radioactive substance to the antibodies, which act as targeting agents to deliver radiation to the tumor cell.</p>\n\n<p>Gene therapy (also called gene transfer) aims to deliver a suicide gene to the tumor cell. It can also be used to boost the immune system. A gene whose activity can be influenced to kill the cell is integrated into a virus that can cross the blood-brain barrier (an elaborate network of fine blood vessels and cells that filters the blood reaching the CNS) and travel to the tumor. Delivery methods under investigation include viruses and stem cells. Gene therapy may become an important add-on therapy for individuals who do not respond well to other treatments.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:262}}</p>\n\n<p>Scientists are testing the effectiveness of vaccine therapy for a variety of CNS tumors. Vaccine therapy strengthens the immune response by inserting an antigen that the body will attack. Some vaccines target a specific antigen, while others, using the whole tumor cell to make the vaccine, hope to target multiple antigens that the tumor may express.  Research has shown the vaccine can be genetically engineered with tumor antigens and injected into the body to induce an immune response, which increases the attack on antigens expressed on the surface of the tumor cell. Experimental CNS tumor vaccines include those designed to stimulate an immune response to a particular protein or antigen, and dendritic cell vaccines (a method in which blood cells are taken from the body, processed in a laboratory and given back to the patient to break up the tumor cell outer protein into smaller pieces, which increases targeting by immune cells).</p>\n\n<p>Findings from NIH-sponsored research on adult CNS tumor development and treatment suggest the immune system and, potentially, infection with the cytomegalovirus may play a critical role in certain tumor-type risk and prognosis.  Repeated stimulation of the immune system to counter this herpes virus may serve as a tumor promotion factor. Scientists hope to identify immune factors and develop targeted immunotherapies for this disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Targeted therapy</b> uses different molecules to reduce tumor gene expression and suppress uncontrolled growth by killing or reducing the production of tumor cells. Of particular interest to scientists is the development of tailored therapeutics—involving a combination of targeted agents—to treat tumors based on their genetic make-up.  Specifically, molecularly targeted drugs seek out the molecular and cellular changes that convert normal cells into cancer. Many targeted cancer therapies are being tested in animals for use alone or in combination with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. Researchers hope to discover tumor-specific cellular or molecular pathways that can be used to increase drug delivery and to find ways to identify patients who may benefit from combined therapy.  Targeted therapies include oncogenes, growth factors, and molecules aimed at blocking gene activity.</p>\n\n<p>Growth factors often govern normal cell growth. Growth factors are released from either the cell or the surrounding tissue. Cancer cells can either secrete these growth factors or respond to them, enabling them to divide out of control. A number of tumor growth factors have been identified, including those that trigger nerve tissue growth and stimulate blood vessels to grow (a process called angiogenesis). Researchers continue to identify and develop agents that can block these factors.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-angiogenetic compounds block blood vessel growth and the flow of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor, and may also hamper cell signaling and stop tumor cells from spreading elsewhere in the body.

More than a dozen such compounds have been identified, including bevacizumab, interferon, and endostatin.

It’s easy to become overwhelmed by a new world of tests, technology, and treatments that your patients may know little or nothing about. This course will provide you with a better understanding of dementia, its treatment options, and the latest research to find safer, more effective ways to diagnose and treat the disease. You can take the best care of your patients by learning about their diagnosis and being able to discuss with them the signs, symptoms, and range of emotions they may be going through.</p>\n\n{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\n\r\n<h1>Dementia</h1>\n\r\n<p>Dementia is <u>not</u> a specific disease. It is a descriptive term <i>for a collection of symptoms</i> that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations.</p>\n\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:389}}</p>\n\r\n<p>Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning—thinking, remembering, and reasoning—and behavioral abilities, to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person’s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others to perform basic activities of daily living.</p>\n\r\n<p>While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does <u>not</u> mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if the patient demonstrates that <i>two or more</i> brain functions, such as: memory, language skills, perception, or cognitive skills including reasoning and judgment, are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness.</p>\n\r\n<h2>Genetics and Dementia</h2>\n\r\n<p>Many people diagnosed with dementia are concerned that dementia may have been inherited through genetics and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and can or may be passed on to their children. Family members of people with dementia are sometimes concerned that they might be more likely to develop dementia themselves. Genes do play a partial role in the development of dementia, but their specific effects vary considerably.</p>\r\n\n<p>The basic material of inheritance, DNA, is passed on from our natural parents in the form of genes. Genes are delivered in packages called chromosomes, which are long chains of genetic instructions.</p>\n\r\n<p>It can be helpful to think of DNA as being the letters of the alphabet, with genes as the words. These words have a biological meaning within our bodies. Sometimes the letters that make up the words are changed, and this then affects their meaning. These effects could be subtle, or could change the biological meaning completely. Both of these types of effect are observed with the genes that contribute to the risk of developing dementia.</p>\n\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:390}}</p>\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that genes that cause major changes to biological meaning are extremely rare. The majority of dementia results from the combination of many genes that have only subtle effects on biological meaning. These effects may also be influenced by the way we live our lives.</p>\n\r\n<p>Genes are found on chromosomes. We all inherit 23 pairs of chromosomes. One half of each pair comes from each parent. There are just <i>fewer</i> than 20,000 genes in the human genome. It is difficult to say just how many of these will influence one\'s risk of developing dementia, but it could be over a hundred.</p>\r\n\n<p>If a parent has dementia, their illness is most likely due to a combination of many genes working together along with lifestyle factors. It is unlikely that the child of this parent would inherit all the disease susceptibility genes, although the risk of disease is slightly increased compared to someone without a parent with dementia.</p>', 1, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(13, 'ds-g31.09-fl-hh_02', '<h2>Classifications of Dementia</h2><p>Dementia disorders can be classified many different ways. The classifications attempt to group disorders that have particular features in common, such as whether they are progressive or what parts of the brain are affected. Some frequently used classifications include the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Cortical dementia:</b> dementia where the brain damage primarily affects the brain’s cortex, or outer layer. Cortical dementias tend to cause problems with memory, language, thinking, and social behavior;\r<li><b>Subcortical dementia:</b> dementia that affects parts of the brain below the cortex. Subcortical dementia tends to cause changes in emotions and movement in addition to problems with memory;\r<li><b>Progressive dementia:</b> dementia that gets worse over time, gradually interfering with more and more cognitive abilities;\r<li><b>Primary dementia:</b> dementia such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) that does not result from any other disease; and\r<li><b>Secondary dementia:</b> dementia that occurs as a result of a physical disease or injury.\r\n</ol>\n<p>Some types of dementia fit into more than one of the above-mentioned classifications. For example, AD is considered both a progressive and a cortical dementia.</p>\n\n<h1>Alzheimer\'s Disease</h1>\n\n<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the <i>most common</i> cause of dementia in people aged 65 and older. Experts believe that up to 4 million people in the United States are currently living with the disease (one in ten people over the age of 65 and nearly half of those over 85 have AD). At least 360,000 Americans are diagnosed with AD each year and about 50,000 are reported to die from it.</p>\n\n<p>In most people, symptoms of AD appear after age 60. However, there are some early-onset forms of the disease, usually linked to a specific gene defect, which may appear as early as age 30. AD usually causes a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, most often during a span of 7 to 10 years. Nearly all brain functions, including memory, movement, language, judgment, behavior, and abstract thinking, are eventually affected.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:391}}</p>\n\n<p>Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually takes away the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. Alzheimer’s disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Dr. Alzheimer noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. Her symptoms included memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. After she died, he examined her brain and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary tangles). Plaques and tangles in the brain are two of the main features of Alzheimer’s disease. The third is the loss of connections between neurons in the brain.</p>\n\n<p>Although we still don’t know how the Alzheimer’s disease process begins, it seems likely that damage to the brain starts a decade or more before problems become evident. During the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease, people are free of symptoms, but toxic changes are taking place in the brain. Abnormal deposits of proteins form amyloid plaques and tau tangles throughout the brain, and once-healthy neurons begin to work less efficiently. Over time, neurons lose their ability to function and communicate with each other, and eventually they die.</p>\n\n<p>Before long, the damage spreads to a nearby structure in the brain called the hippocampus, which is essential in forming memories. As more neurons die, affected brain regions begin to shrink. At the final stage of Alzheimer’s, damage is widespread, and brain tissue has shrunk significantly.</p>', 2, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

When this happens, the microtubules cannot function correctly and they disintegrate. This collapse of the neuron\'s transport system may impair communication between nerve cells and cause them to die.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:393}}</p>\n\n<p>At this point, researchers do not know if amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are harmful or if they are merely side effects of the disease process that damages neurons and leads to the symptoms of AD.

It accounts for up to 20 percent of all dementias and is caused by brain damage from cerebrovascular or cardiovascular problems—usually strokes. It also may result from genetic diseases, endocarditis, or amyloid angiopathy (a process in which amyloid protein builds up in the brain\'s blood vessels, sometimes causing hemorrhagic or "bleeding" strokes). In many cases, it may coexist with AD. The incidence of vascular dementia increases with advancing age and is similar in men and women.</p>\n\n<h2>Symptoms of Vascular Dementia</h2>\n\n<p>Symptoms of vascular dementia often begin suddenly, frequently after a stroke. Patients may have a history of hypertension, vascular disease, or previous strokes or heart attacks. Vascular dementia may or may not get worse with time, depending on whether the person has additional strokes. In some cases, symptoms may get better with time. When the disease does get worse, it often progresses in a stepwise manner, with sudden changes in ability.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:394}}</p>\n\n<p>People with vascular dementia frequently wander at night and often have other problems commonly found in people who have had a stroke, including depression and incontinence.</p>\n\n<p>Vascular dementia with brain damage to the mid-brain regions, however, may cause a gradual, progressive cognitive impairment that may look much like AD. Unlike people with AD, people with vascular dementia often maintain their personality and normal levels of emotional responsiveness until the later stages of the disease.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of Vascular Dementia</h2>\n\n<p>There are several types and subtypes of vascular dementia with varying causes and symptoms with multi-infarct dementia (MID), Binswanger’s disease, and Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarct and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) being the most prevalent.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is caused by numerous small strokes in the brain. MID typically includes multiple damaged areas, called infarcts, along with extensive lesions in the white matter, or nerve fibers, of the brain. Because the infarcts in MID affect isolated areas of the brain, the symptoms are often limited to one side of the body or they may affect just one or a few specific functions, such as language. Neurologists call these local or focal symptoms, as opposed to the global symptoms seen in AD, which affect many functions and are not restricted to one side of the body.<br><br>\n\nAlthough not all strokes cause dementia, in some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This condition is called single-infarct dementia. Dementia is more common when the stroke takes place in the left hemisphere of the brain and/or when it involves the hippocampus.</li><br>\n<li>Another type of vascular dementia is called Binswanger\'s disease. This rare form of dementia is characterized by damage to small blood vessels in the white matter of the brain, which is found in the inner layers of the brain and contains many nerve fibers coated with a whitish, fatty substance called myelin. Binswanger\'s disease leads to brain lesions, loss of memory, disordered cognition, and mood changes. Patients with this disease often show signs of abnormal blood pressure, stroke, blood abnormalities, disease of the large blood vessels in the neck, and/or disease of the heart valves.<br><br>\n\nOther prominent features include urinary incontinence, difficulty walking, clumsiness, slowness, lack of facial expression, and speech difficulty. These symptoms, which usually begin after the age of 60, are not always present in all patients and may sometimes appear only temporarily.<br><br>\n\nTreatment of Binswanger\'s disease is symptomatic, and may include the use of medications to control hypertension, depression, heart arrhythmias, and hypotension. The disorder often includes episodes of partial recovery.</li><br>\n\n<li>The third type of vascular dementia is linked to a rare hereditary disorder called Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarct and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is linked to abnormalities of a specific gene, Notch3, which is located on chromosome 19. This condition causes multi-infarct dementia as well as stroke, migraine with aura, and mood disorders. The first symptoms usually appear in people who are in their twenties, thirties, or forties and affected individuals often die by age 65. Researchers believe most people with CADASIL go undiagnosed, and the actual prevalence of the disease is not yet known.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other causes of vascular dementia include vasculitis, profound hypotension, and lesions caused by brain hemorrhage.

Many of the remaining nerve cells in the substantia nigra contain abnormal structures called Lewy bodies that are the hallmark of the disease. Lewy bodies may also appear in the brain\'s cortex, or outer layer. Lewy bodies contain a protein called alpha-synuclein that has been linked to Parkinson\'s disease and several other disorders. Researchers, who sometimes refer to these disorders collectively as synucleinopathies, do not yet know why this protein accumulates inside nerve cells in LBD.</p>\n\n<h2>Symptoms and Treatments for LBD</h2>\n\n<p>The symptoms of LBD overlap with AD in many ways, and may include memory impairment, poor judgment, and confusion. However, LBD typically also includes visual hallucinations, parkinsonian symptoms such as a shuffling gait and flexed posture, and day-to-day fluctuations in the severity of symptoms. Patients with LBD live an average of 7 years after symptoms begin.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:396}}</p>\n\n<p>There is <u>no</u> cure for LBD, and treatments are aimed at controlling the parkinsonian and psychiatric symptoms of the disorder.

The duration of FTD varies, with some patients declining rapidly over 2 to 3 years and others showing only minimal changes for many years. People with FTD live with the disease for an average of 5 to 10 years after diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>Because structures found in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain control judgment and social behavior, people with FTD often have problems maintaining normal interactions and following social conventions. They may steal or exhibit impolite and socially inappropriate behavior, and they may neglect their normal responsibilities. Other common symptoms include loss of speech and language, compulsive or repetitive behavior, increased appetite, and motor problems such as stiffness and balance problems. Memory loss also may occur, although it typically appears late in the disease.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of Frontotemporal Dementia</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In one type of FTD called Pick\'s disease, certain nerve cells become abnormal and swollen before they die. These swollen, or ballooned, neurons are one hallmark of the disease. The brains of people with Pick\'s disease also have abnormal structures called Pick bodies, composed largely of the protein tau, inside the neurons. The cause of Pick\'s disease is unknown, but it runs in some families and thus it is probably due at least in part to a faulty gene or genes.<br><br>The disease usually begins after age 50 and causes changes in personality and behavior that gradually worsen over time. The symptoms of Pick\'s disease are very similar to those of AD, and may include inappropriate social behavior, loss of mental flexibility, language problems, and difficulty with thinking and concentration. There is currently no way to slow the progressive degeneration found in Pick\'s disease. However, medication may be helpful in reducing aggression and other behavioral problems, and in treating depression.<br><br>In some cases, familial FTD is linked to a mutation in the tau gene.

Most cases of CJD occur sporadically—that is, in people who have no known risk factors for the disease. However, about 5 to 10 percent of cases of CJD in the United States are hereditary, caused by a mutation in the gene for the prion protein.

Patients with Niemann-Pick disease cannot properly metabolize cholesterol and other lipids. Consequently, excessive amounts of cholesterol accumulate in the liver and spleen and excessive amounts of other lipids accumulate in the brain. Symptoms may include dementia, confusion, and problems with learning and memory. These diseases usually begin in young school-age children, but may also appear during the teen years or early adulthood.</li>\n	<li>Batten disease is a fatal, hereditary disorder of the nervous system that begins in childhood. Symptoms are linked to a buildup of substances called lipopigments in the body\'s tissues. The early symptoms include personality and behavior changes, slow learning, clumsiness, or stumbling. Over time, affected children suffer mental impairment, seizures, and progressive loss of sight and motor skills. Eventually, children with Batten disease develop dementia and become blind and bedridden.

Because these inclusions, which contain abnormal proteins, are so common in people with dementia, researchers suspect that they play a role in the development of symptoms. However, that role is unknown, and in some cases the inclusions may simply be a side effect of the disease process that leads to the dementia.</p>\r\r<p>Genes clearly play a role in the development of some kinds of dementia. However, in AD and many other disorders, the dementia usually cannot be tied to a single abnormal gene. Instead, these forms of dementia appear to result from a complex interaction of genes, lifestyle factors, and other environmental influences.</p>\r\r<p>Researchers have identified several genes that influence susceptibility to AD. Mutations in three of the known genes for AD that control the production of proteins such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1, and presenilin 2, are linked to early-onset forms of the disease.</p>\r\r<p>Variations in another gene, called apolipoprotein E (apoE), have been linked to an increased risk of late-onset AD.

This gene variant seems to encourage amyloid deposition in the brain. One study also found that this gene is associated with shorter survival in men with AD. In contrast, another version of the apoE gene, called apoE epsilon2 (apoE E2), appears to protect against AD.</p>\r\r<p>Studies have suggested that mutations in another gene, called CYP46, may contribute to an increased risk of developing late-onset sporadic AD. This gene normally produces a protein that helps the brain metabolize cholesterol.\rScientists are trying to determine how beta amyloid influences the development of AD. A number of studies indicate that the buildup of this protein initiates a complex chain of events that culminates in dementia.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One study found that beta amyloid buildup in the brain triggers cells called microglia, which act like janitors that mop up potentially harmful substances in the brain, to release a potent neurotoxin called peroxynitrite. This may contribute to nerve cell death in AD.</li>\r<li>Another study found that beta amyloid causes a protein called p35 to be split into two proteins. One of the resulting proteins triggers changes in the tau protein that lead to formation of neurofibrillary tangles.</li>\r<li>A third study found that beta amyloid activates cell-death enzymes called caspases that alter the tau protein in a way that causes it to form tangles. Researchers believe these tangles may contribute to the neuron death in AD.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vascular dementia can be caused by cerebrovascular disease or any other condition that prevents normal blood flow to the brain.

Tests can determine if any of these problems are present.</li>\r<li>Nutritional deficiencies of thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) frequently result from chronic alcoholism and can seriously impair mental abilities, in particular memories of recent events. Severe deficiency of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> can cause a neurological illness called pellagra that may include dementia.

In most cases, it is still impossible to predict a specific person\'s risk of the disorder based on family history alone. Some families with CJD, GSS, or fatal familial insomnia have mutations in the prion protein gene, although these disorders can also occur in people without the gene mutation. Individuals with these mutations are at significantly higher risk of developing these forms of dementia. Abnormal genes are also clearly implicated as risk factors in Huntington\'s disease, FTDP-17, and several other kinds of dementia.</li>\r<li><b>Smoking and alcohol use:</b> several recent studies have found that smoking significantly increases the risk of mental decline and dementia. People who smoke have a higher risk of atherosclerosis and other types of vascular disease, which may be the underlying causes for the increased dementia risk. Studies also have found that drinking large amounts of alcohol appears to increase the risk of dementia. However, other studies have suggested that people who drink moderately have a lower risk of dementia than either those who drink heavily or those who completely abstain from drinking.</li>\r<li><b>Atherosclerosis:</b> atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque, deposits of fatty substances, cholesterol, and other matter in the inner lining of an artery. Atherosclerosis is a significant risk factor for vascular dementia, because it interferes with the delivery of blood to the brain and can lead to stroke. Studies have also found a possible link between atherosclerosis and AD.</li>\r<li><b>Cholesterol:</b> high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad form of cholesterol, appear to significantly increase a person\'s risk of developing vascular dementia. Some research has also linked high cholesterol to an increased risk of AD.</li>\r<li><b>Plasma homocysteine:</b> research has shown that a higher-than-average blood level of homocysteine, a type of amino acid, is a strong risk factor for the development of AD and vascular dementia.</li>\r<li><b>Diabetes:</b> diabetes is a risk factor for both AD and vascular dementia. It is also a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and stroke, both of which contribute to vascular dementia.</li>\r<li><b>Mild cognitive impairment:</b> while not all people with mild cognitive impairment develop dementia, people with this condition do have a significantly increased risk of dementia compared to the rest of the population. One study found that approximately 40 percent of people over age 65 who were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment developed dementia within 3 years.</li>\r<li><b>Down syndrome:</b> studies have found that most people with Down syndrome develop characteristic AD plaques and neurofibrillary tangles by the time they reach middle age.

These people also may benefit from drug treatment.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>gold standard</em> for diagnosing dementia, autopsy, does not help the patient or caregivers. Therefore, doctors have devised a number of techniques to help identify dementia with reasonable accuracy while the patient is still alive.</p>\r\r<h2>Patient History</h2>\n\n<p>Doctors often begin their examination of a patient suspected of having dementia by asking questions about the patient\'s history. For example, they may ask how and when symptoms developed and about the patient\'s overall medical condition. They also may try to evaluate the patient\'s emotional state, although patients with dementia often may be unaware of or in denial about how their disease is affecting them. Family members also may deny the existence of the disease because they do not want to accept the diagnosis and because, in the beginning stages, AD and other forms of dementia can resemble normal aging. Therefore, additional steps are necessary to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of dementia.</p>\n\n<h2>Physical Examination</h2>\n\n<p>A physical examination can help rule out treatable causes of dementia and identify signs of stroke or other disorders that can contribute to dementia. It can also identify signs of other illnesses, such as heart disease or kidney failure that can overlap with dementia. If a patient is taking medications that may be causing or contributing to his or her symptoms, the doctor may suggest stopping or replacing some medications to see if the symptoms go away.</p>\n\n<h2>Neurological Evaluation</h2>\n\n<p>Doctors will perform a neurological examination, looking at balance, sensory function, reflexes, and other functions, to identify signs of conditions—for example, movement disorders or stroke—that may affect the patient\'s diagnosis or are treatable with drugs.</p>\n\n<h2>Cognitive and Neuropsychological Tests</h2>\n\n<p>Doctors use tests that measure memory, language skills, math skills, and other abilities related to mental functioning to help them diagnose a patient\'s condition accurately. For example, people with AD often show changes in so-called executive functions (such as problem-solving), memory, and the ability to perform routine tasks.</p>\r\r<p>Doctors often use a test called the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive skills in people with suspected dementia.

In individuals with cortical atrophy, the progressive loss of neurons causes the gyri to become thinner and the sulci to grow wider.</p> \r\r<p>As brain cells die, the ventricles or fluid-filled cavities in the middle of the brain expand to fill the available space, becoming much larger than normal.

Doctors frequently request a CT scan of the brain when they are examining a patient with suspected dementia. These scans, which use X-rays to detect brain structures, can show evidence of brain atrophy, strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), changes to the blood vessels, and other problems such as hydrocephalus and subdural hematomas. MRI scans use magnetic fields and focused radio waves to detect hydrogen atoms in tissues within the body. They can detect the same problems as CT scans, but they are better for identifying certain conditions, such as brain atrophy and damage from small TIAs.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:405}}</p>\n\n<p>Doctors also may use electroencephalograms (EEGs) in people with suspected dementia. In an EEG, electrodes are placed on the scalp over several parts of the brain in order to detect and record patterns of electrical activity and check for abnormalities. This electrical activity can indicate cognitive dysfunction in part or all of the brain. Many patients with moderately severe to severe AD have abnormal EEGs.

A preliminary study has shown that high doses of three B vitamins that help lower homocysteine levels—folic acid, B<sub>12</sub>, and B<sub>6</sub>—appear to slow the progression of AD. Researchers are conducting a multi-center clinical trial to test this effect in a larger group of patients.</li>\r<li><b>Lowering cholesterol levels:</b> research has suggested that people with high cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing AD. Cholesterol is involved in formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Mutations in a gene called CYP46 and the apoE E4 gene variant, both of which have been linked to an increased risk of AD, are also involved in cholesterol metabolism. Several studies have also found that the use of drugs called statins, which lower cholesterol levels, is associated with a lower likelihood of cognitive impairment.</li>\r<li><b>Lowering blood pressure:</b> several studies have shown that antihypertensive medicine reduces the odds of cognitive impairment in elderly people with high blood pressure. One large European study found a 55 percent lower risk of dementia in people over 60 who received drug treatment for hypertension. These people had a reduced risk of both AD and vascular dementia.</li>\r<li><b>Exercise:</b> regular exercise stimulates production of chemicals called growth factors that help neurons survive and adapt to new situations. These gains may help to delay the onset of dementia symptoms. Exercise also may reduce the risk of brain damage from atherosclerosis.</li>\r<li><b>Education:</b> researchers have found evidence that formal education may help protect people against the effects of AD. In one study, researchers found that people with more years of formal education had relatively less mental decline than people with less schooling, regardless of the number of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles each person had in his or her brain. The researchers think education may cause the brain to develop robust nerve cell networks that can help compensate for the cell damage caused by AD.</li>\r<li><b>Controlling inflammation:</b> many studies have suggested that inflammation may contribute to AD. Moreover, autopsies of people who died with AD have shown widespread inflammation in the brain that appeared to be caused by the accumulation of beta amyloid. Another study found that men with high levels of C-reactive protein, a general marker of inflammation, had a significantly increased risk of AD and other kinds of dementia.</li>\r<li><b>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):</b> research indicates that long-term use of NSAIDs—ibuprofen, naproxen, and similar drugs—may prevent or delay the onset of AD. Researchers are not sure how these drugs may protect against the disease, but some or all of the effect may be due to reduced inflammation. A 2003 study showed that these drugs also bind to amyloid plaques and may help to dissolve them and prevent formation of new plaques.\r</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The risk of vascular dementia is strongly correlated with risk factors for stroke, including high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, and smoking.

Reducing unnecessary activity and noise (such as limiting the number of visitors and turning off the television when it\'s not in use) may make it easier for the person to understand requests and perform simple tasks.

Although not completely understood, these defects can form wherever there are arteries or veins in the brain or spinal cord and may be linked to genetic mutations.

They are comprised of snarled tangles of arteries and veins. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body’s cells; veins return oxygen-depleted blood to the lungs and heart. The presence of an AVM disrupts this vital cyclical process. Although AVMs can develop in many different sites, those located in the brain or spinal cord—the two parts of the central nervous system—can have especially widespread effects on the body.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:105}}</p>\r\n\n\n<p>\r\n	AVMs of the brain or spinal cord (neurological AVMs) are believed to affect approximately 300,000 Americans. They occur in males and females of all racial or ethnic backgrounds at roughly equal rates.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Symptoms of AVMs</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Most people with neurological AVMs experience few, if any, significant symptoms, and the malformations tend to be discovered only incidentally, usually either at autopsy or during treatment for an unrelated disorder. But for about 12 percent of the affected population (about 36,000 of the estimated 300,000 Americans with AVMs), these abnormalities cause symptoms that vary greatly in severity. For a small fraction of the individuals within this group, such symptoms are severe enough to become debilitating or even life threatening. Each year about 1 percent of those with AVMs will die as a direct result of the AVM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seizures and headaches are the most generalized symptoms of AVMs, but no particular type of seizure or headache pattern has been identified. Seizures can be partial or total, involving a loss of control over movement, convulsions, or a change in a person’s level of consciousness. Headaches can vary greatly in frequency, duration, and intensity, sometimes becoming as severe as migraines. Sometimes a headache consistently affecting one side of the head may be closely linked to the site of an AVM. More frequently, however, the location of the pain is not specific to the lesion and may encompass most of the head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AVMs also can cause a wide range of more specific neurological symptoms that vary from person to person, depending primarily upon the location of the AVM. Such symptoms may include muscle weakness or paralysis in one part of the body; ataxia that can lead to such problems as gait disturbances; apraxia, or difficulties carrying out tasks that require planning; dizziness; visual disturbances such as a loss of part of the visual field; an inability to control eye movement; papilledema; aphasia; abnormal sensations such as numbness, tingling, or spontaneous pain (paresthesia or dysesthesia); memory deficits; and mental confusion, hallucinations, or dementia. Researchers have recently uncovered evidence that AVMs may also cause subtle learning or behavioral disorders in some people during their childhood or adolescence, long before more obvious symptoms become evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more distinctive signs indicating the presence of an AVM is an auditory phenomenon called a bruit, coined from the French word meaning noise. (A sign is a physical effect observable by a physician, but not by a patient.) Doctors use this term to describe the rhythmic, whooshing sound caused by excessively rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins of an AVM. The sound is similar to that made by a torrent of water rushing through a narrow pipe. A bruit can sometimes become a symptom—that is, an effect experienced by a patient—when it is especially severe. When audible to patients, the bruit may compromise hearing, disturb sleep, or cause significant psychological distress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Symptoms caused by AVMs can appear at any age, but because these abnormalities tend to result from a slow buildup of neurological damage over time they are most often noticed when people are in their twenties, thirties, or forties. If AVMs do not become symptomatic by the time people reach their late forties or early fifties, they tend to remain stable and rarely produce symptoms. In women, pregnancy sometimes causes a sudden onset or worsening of symptoms, due to accompanying cardiovascular changes, especially increases in blood volume and blood pressure.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast to the vast majority of neurological AVMs, one especially severe type causes symptoms to appear at, or very soon after, birth. Called a vein of Galen defect after the major blood vessel involved, this lesion is located deep inside the brain. It is frequently associated with hydrocephalus, swollen veins visible on the scalp, seizures, failure to thrive, and congestive heart failure. Children born with this condition who survive past infancy often remain developmentally impaired.</p>\r\n', 1, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(33, 'ds-q27.30_02', '<h2>AVMs and the Central Nervous System</h2><p>AVMs become symptomatic only when the damage they cause to the brain or spinal cord reaches a critical level. This is one of the reasons why a relatively small fraction of people with these lesions experiences significant health problems related to the condition. AVMs damage the brain or spinal cord through three basic mechanisms: by reducing the amount of oxygen reaching neurological tissues; by causing bleeding (hemorrhage) into surrounding tissues; and by compressing or displacing parts of the brain or spinal cord.</p>\r\n<p>AVMs compromise oxygen delivery to the brain or spinal cord by altering normal patterns of blood flow. Arteries and veins are normally interconnected by a series of progressively smaller blood vessels that control and slow the rate of blood flow. Oxygen delivery to surrounding tissues takes place through the thin, porous walls of the smallest of these interconnecting vessels, known as capillaries, where the blood flows most slowly. The arteries and veins that make up AVMs, however, lack this intervening capillary network. Instead, arteries dump blood directly into veins through a passageway called a fistula. The flow rate is uncontrolled and extremely rapid—too rapid to allow oxygen to be dispersed to surrounding tissues. When starved of normal amounts of oxygen, the cells that make up these tissues begin to deteriorate, sometimes dying off completely.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:106}}</p>\r\n\n<p>This abnormally rapid rate of blood flow frequently causes blood pressure inside the vessels located in the central portion of an AVM directly adjacent to the fistula—an area doctors refer to as the nidus, from the Latin word for nest—to rise to dangerously high levels. The arteries feeding blood into the AVM often become swollen and distorted; the veins that drain blood away from it often become abnormally constricted (a condition called stenosis). Moreover, the walls of the involved arteries and veins are often abnormally thin and weak. Aneurysms—balloon-like bulges in blood vessel walls that are susceptible to rupture—may develop in association with approximately half of all neurological AVMs due to this structural weakness.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Bleeding can result from this combination of high internal pressure and vessel wall weakness. Such hemorrhages are often microscopic in size, causing limited damage and few significant symptoms. Even many nonsymptomatic AVMs show evidence of past bleeding. But massive hemorrhages can occur if the physical stresses caused by extremely high blood pressure, rapid blood flow rates, and vessel wall weakness are great enough. If a large enough volume of blood escapes from a ruptured AVM into the surrounding brain, the result can be a catastrophic stroke. AVMs account for approximately 2 percent of all hemorrhagic strokes that occur each year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Even in the absence of bleeding or significant oxygen depletion, large AVMs can damage the brain or spinal cord simply by their presence. They can range in size from a fraction of an inch to more than 2.5 inches in diameter, depending on the number and size of the blood vessels making up the lesion. The larger the lesion, the greater the amount of pressure it exerts on surrounding brain or spinal cord structures. The largest lesions may compress several inches of the spinal cord or distort the shape of an entire hemisphere of the brain. Such massive AVMs can constrict the flow of cerebrospinal fluid—a clear liquid that normally nourishes and protects the brain and spinal cord—by distorting or closing the passageways and open chambers (ventricles) inside the brain that allow this fluid to circulate freely. As cerebrospinal fluid accumulates, hydrocephalus results. This fluid buildup further increases the amount of pressure on fragile neurological structures, adding to the damage caused by the AVM itself.</p>\r\n', 2, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(34, 'ds-q27.30_03', '<h2>AVM Formation</h2><p>AVMs can form virtually anywhere in the brain or spinal cord—wherever arteries and veins exist. Some are formed from blood vessels located in the dura mater or in the pia mater, the outermost and innermost, respectively, of the three membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. (The third membrane, called the arachnoid, lacks blood vessels.) AVMs affecting the spinal cord are of two types, AVMs of the dura mater, which affect the function of the spinal cord by transmitting excess pressure to the venous system of the spinal cord, and AVMs of the spinal cord itself, which affect the function of the spinal cord by hemorrhage, by reducing blood flow to the spinal cord, or by causing excess venous pressure. Spinal AVMs frequently cause attacks of sudden, severe back pain, often concentrated at the roots of nerve fibers where they exit the vertebrae; the pain is similar to that caused by a slipped disk. These lesions also can cause sensory disturbances, muscle weakness, or paralysis in the parts of the body served by the spinal cord or the damaged nerve fibers. Spinal cord injury by the AVM by either of the mechanisms described above can lead to degeneration of the nerve fibers within the spinal cord below the level of the lesion, causing widespread paralysis in parts of the body controlled by those nerve fibers.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:107}}</p>\r\n\n<p>Dural and pial AVMs can appear anywhere on the surface of the brain. Those located on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres—the uppermost portions of the brain—exert pressure on the cerebral cortex, the brain’s “gray matter.” Depending on their location, these AVMs may damage portions of the cerebral cortex involved with thinking, speaking, understanding language, hearing, taste, touch, or initiating and controlling voluntary movements. AVMs located on the frontal lobe close to the optic nerve or on the occipital lobe, the rear portion of the cerebrum where images are processed, may cause a variety of visual disturbances.</p>\r\n<p>AVMs also can form from blood vessels located deep inside the interior of the cerebrum. These AVMs may compromise the functions of three vital structures: the thalamus, which transmits nerve signals between the spinal cord and upper regions of the brain; the basal ganglia surrounding the thalamus, which coordinate complex movements; and the hippocampus, which plays a major role in memory.</p>\r\n<p>AVMs can affect other parts of the brain besides the cerebrum. The hindbrain is formed from two major structures: the cerebellum, which is nestled under the rear portion of the cerebrum, and the brainstem, which serves as the bridge linking the upper portions of the brain with the spinal cord. These structures control finely coordinated movements, maintain balance, and regulate some functions of internal organs, including those of the heart and lungs. AVM damage to these parts of the hindbrain can result in dizziness, giddiness, vomiting, a loss of the ability to coordinate complex movements such as walking, or uncontrollable muscle tremors.</p>\r\n', 3, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(35, 'ds-q27.30_04', '<h2>Health Consequences of AVMs</h2><p>The greatest potential danger posed by AVMs is hemorrhage. Researchers believe that each year between 2 and 4 percent of all AVMs hemorrhage. Most episodes of bleeding remain undetected at the time they occur because they are not severe enough to cause significant neurological damage. But massive, even fatal, bleeding episodes do occur. The present state of knowledge does not permit doctors to predict whether or not any particular person with an AVM will suffer an extensive hemorrhage. The lesions can remain stable or can suddenly begin to grow. In a few cases, they have been observed to regress spontaneously. Whenever an AVM is detected, the individual should be carefully and consistently monitored for any signs of instability that may indicate an increased risk of hemorrhage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	A few physical characteristics appear to indicate a greater-than-usual likelihood of clinically significant hemorrhage. Smaller AVMs have a greater likelihood of bleeding than do larger ones. Impaired drainage by unusually narrow or deeply situated veins also increases the chances of hemorrhage. Pregnancy also appears to increase the likelihood of clinically significant hemorrhage, mainly because of increases in blood pressure and blood volume. Finally, AVMs that have hemorrhaged once are about nine times more likely to bleed again during the first year after the initial hemorrhage than are lesions that have never bled.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:108}}</p>\r\n\n<p>The damaging effects of a hemorrhage are related to lesion location. Bleeding from AVMs located deep inside the interior tissues, or parenchyma, of the brain typically causes more severe neurological damage than does hemorrhage by lesions that have formed in the dural or pial membranes or on the surface of the brain or spinal cord. (Deeply located bleeding is usually referred to as an intracerebral or parenchymal hemorrhage; bleeding within the membranes or on the surface of the brain is known as subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage.) Thus, location is an important factor to consider when weighing the relative risks of surgical versus non-surgical treatment of AVMs.</p>\r\n<h1>\r\n	Other Types of Vascular Lesions</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	Besides AVMs, three other main types of vascular lesion can arise in the brain or spinal cord: cavernous malformations, capillary telangiectases, and venous malformations. These lesions may form virtually anywhere within the central nervous system, but unlike AVMs, they are not caused by high-velocity blood flow from arteries into veins. In contrast, cavernous malformations, telangiectases, and venous malformations are all low-flow lesions. Instead of a combination of arteries and veins, each one involves only one type of blood vessel. These lesions are less unstable than AVMs and do not pose the same relatively high risk of significant hemorrhage. In general, low-flow lesions tend to cause fewer troubling neurological symptoms and require less aggressive treatment than do AVMs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Cavernous Malformations</h2>\r\n<p>These lesions are formed from groups of tightly packed, abnormally thin-walled, small blood vessels that displace normal neurological tissue in the brain or spinal cord. The vessels are filled with slow-moving or stagnant blood that is usually clotted or in a state of decomposition. Like AVMs, cavernous malformations can range in size from a few fractions of an inch to several inches in diameter, depending on the number of blood vessels involved. Some people develop multiple lesions. Although cavernous malformations usually do not hemorrhage as severely as AVMs do, they sometimes leak blood into surrounding neurological tissues because the walls of the involved blood vessels are extremely fragile. Although they are often not as symptomatic as AVMs, cavernous malformations can cause seizures in some people. After AVMs, cavernous malformations are the type of vascular lesion most likely to require treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Capillary Telangiectases</h2>\r\n<p>These lesions consist of groups of abnormally swollen capillaries and usually measure less than an inch in diameter. Capillaries are the smallest of all blood vessels, with diameters smaller than that of a human hair; they have the capacity to transport only small quantities of blood, and blood flows through these vessels very slowly. Because of these factors, telangiectases rarely cause extensive damage to surrounding brain or spinal cord tissues. Any isolated hemorrhages that occur are microscopic in size. Thus, the lesions are usually benign. However, in some inherited disorders in which people develop large numbers of these lesions (see below), telangiectases can contribute to the development of nonspecific neurological symptoms such as headaches or seizures.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Venous Malformations</h2>\r\n<p>These lesions consist of abnormally enlarged veins.

	(36, 'ds-q27.30_05', '<h2>Causes of Vascular Lesions</h2><p>Although the cause of these vascular anomalies of the central nervous system is not yet well understood, scientists believe that they most often result from mistakes that occur during embryonic or fetal development. These mistakes may be linked to genetic mutations in some cases. A few types of vascular malformations are known to be hereditary and thus are known to have a genetic basis. Some evidence also suggests that at least some of these lesions are acquired later in life as a result of injury to the central nervous system.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:109}}</p>\r\n\n<p>During fetal development, new blood vessels continuously form and then disappear as the human body changes and grows. These changes in the body’s vascular map continue after birth and are controlled by angiogenic factors, chemicals produced by the body that stimulate new blood vessel formation and growth. Researchers have recently identified changes in the chemical structures of various angiogenic factors in some people who have AVMs or other vascular abnormalities of the central nervous system. However, it is not yet clear how these chemical changes actually cause changes in blood vessel structure.</p>\r\n<p>By studying patterns of familial occurrence, researchers have established that one type of cavernous malformation involving multiple lesion formation is caused by a genetic mutation in chromosome 7. This genetic mutation appears in many ethnic groups, but it is especially frequent in a large population of Hispanic Americans living in the Southwest; these individuals share a common ancestor in whom the genetic change occurred. Some other types of vascular defects of the central nervous system are part of larger medical syndromes known to be hereditary. They include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease), Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, Parkes-Weber syndrome, and Wyburn-Mason syndrome.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Detection of AVMs and Other Vascular Lesions</h2>\r\n<p>Physicians now use an array of traditional and new imaging technologies to uncover the presence of AVMs. Angiography provides the most accurate pictures of blood vessel structure in AVMs. The technique requires injecting a special water-soluble dye, called a contrast agent, into an artery. The dye highlights the structure of blood vessels so that it can be recorded on conventional X-rays. Although angiography can record fine details of vascular lesions, the procedure is somewhat invasive and carries a slight risk of causing a stroke. Its safety, however, has recently been improved through the development of more precise techniques for delivering dye to the site of an AVM. Superselective angiography involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery; a physician guides the tip of the catheter to the site of the lesion and then releases a small amount of contrast agent directly into the lesion.</p>\r\n<p>Two of the most frequently employed noninvasive imaging technologies used to detect AVMs are computed axial tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. CT scans use X-rays to create a series of cross-sectional images of the head, brain, or spinal cord and are especially useful in revealing the presence of hemorrhage. MRI imaging, however, offers superior diagnostic information by using magnetic fields to detect subtle changes in neurological tissues. A recently developed application of MRI technology—magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—can record the pattern and velocity of blood flow through vascular lesions as well as the flow of cerebrospinal fluid throughout the brain and spinal cord. CT, MRI, and MRA can provide three-dimensional representations of AVMs by taking images from multiple angles.</p>\r\n', 5, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(37, 'ds-q27.30_06', '<h2>Treatment of AVMs and Other Vascular Lesions</h2><p>Medication can often alleviate general symptoms such as headache, back pain, and seizures caused by AVMs and other vascular lesions. However, the definitive treatment for AVMs is either surgery or focused irradiation therapy. Venous malformations and capillary telangiectases rarely require surgery; moreover, their structures are diffuse and usually not suitable for surgical correction and they usually do not require treatment anyway. Cavernous malformations are usually well defined enough for surgical removal, but surgery on these lesions is less common than for AVMs because they do not pose the same risk of hemorrhage.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:110}}</p>\r\n\n<p>\r\n	The decision to perform surgery on any individual with an AVM requires a careful consideration of possible benefits versus risks. The natural history of an individual AVM is difficult to predict; however, left untreated, they have the potential of causing significant hemorrhage, which may result in serious neurological deficits or death. On the other hand, surgery on any part of the central nervous system carries its own risks as well; AVM surgery is associated with an estimated 8 percent risk of serious complications or death. There is no easy formula that can allow physicians and their patients to reach a decision on the best course of therapy—all therapeutic decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Today, three surgical options exist for the treatment of AVMs: conventional surgery, endovascular embolization, and radiosurgery. The choice of treatment depends largely on the size and location of an AVM.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Conventional Surgery</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Conventional surgery involves entering the brain or spinal cord and removing the central portion of the AVM, including the fistula, while causing as little damage as possible to surrounding neurological structures. This surgery is most appropriate when an AVM is located in a superficial portion of the brain or spinal cord and is relatively small in size. AVMs located deep inside the brain generally cannot be approached through conventional surgical techniques because there is too great a possibility that functionally important brain tissue will be damaged or destroyed.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Endovascular Embolization</h3>\r\n<p>Endovascular embolization and radiosurgery are less invasive than conventional surgery and offer safer treatment options for some AVMs located deep inside the brain. In endovascular embolization the surgeon guides a catheter though the arterial network until the tip reaches the site of the AVM. The surgeon then introduces a substance that will plug the fistula, correcting the abnormal pattern of blood flow. This process is known as embolization because it causes an embolus to travel through blood vessels, eventually becoming lodged in a vessel and obstructing blood flow. The materials used to create an artificial blood clot in the center of an AVM include fast-drying biologically inert glues, fibered titanium coils, and tiny balloons. Since embolization usually does not permanently obliterate the AVM, it is usually used as an adjunct to surgery or to radiosurgery to reduce the blood flow through the AVM and make the surgery safer.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Radiosurgery</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Radiosurgery is an even less invasive therapeutic approach. It involves aiming a beam of highly focused radiation directly on the AVM. The high dose of radiation damages the walls of the blood vessels making up the lesion. Over the course of the next several months, the irradiated vessels gradually degenerate and eventually close, leading to the resolution of the AVM.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Embolization frequently proves incomplete or temporary, although in recent years new embolization materials have led to improved results. Radiosurgery often has incomplete results as well, particularly when an AVM is large, and it poses the additional risk of radiation damage to surrounding normal tissues. Moreover, even when successful, complete closure of an AVM takes place over the course of many months following radiosurgery. During that period, the risk of hemorrhage is still present. However, both techniques now offer the possibility of treating deeply situated AVMs that had previously been inaccessible. And in many patients, staged embolization followed by conventional surgical removal or by radiosurgery is now performed, resulting in further reductions in mortality and complication rates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Because so many variables are involved in treating AVMs, doctors must assess the danger posed to individual patients largely on a case-by-case basis. The consequences of hemorrhage are potentially disastrous, leading many clinicians to recommend surgical intervention whenever the physical characteristics of an AVM appear to indicate a greater-than-usual likelihood of significant bleeding and resultant neurological damage.</p>\r\n', 6, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

As part of its mission, the NINDS conducts research on AVMs and other vascular lesions of the central nervous system and supports studies through grants to major medical institutions across the country.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	In partnership with the medical school of Columbia University, the NINDS has established a long-term Arteriovenous Study Group to learn more about the natural course of AVMs in patients and to improve the surgical treatment of these lesions.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:111}}</p>\r\n\n<p>\r\n	Another group of NINDS-sponsored researchers is currently studying large populations of patients with AVMs to formulate criteria that will allow doctors to predict more accurately the risk of hemorrhage in individual patients. Of particular importance is the role that high blood pressure within the lesion plays in the onset of hemorrhage. Other scientists are examining the genetic basis of familial cavernous malformations and other hereditary syndromes that cause neurological vascular lesions, including ataxia telangiectasia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Other scientists are seeking to refine the techniques now available to treat AVMs. Radiosurgery is a special area of interest because this technology is still in its infancy. An ongoing study is closely examining the precise effects that radiation exposure has on vascular tissue in order to improve the predictability and consistency of treatment results.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Finally, several ongoing studies are devoted to developing new noninvasive neuroimaging technologies to increase the effectiveness and safety of AVM surgery. Some scientists are pioneering the use of MRI to measure amounts of oxygen present in the brain tissue of patients with vascular lesions in order to predict the brain’s response to surgical therapies. Others are developing a new micro-imager that may be inserted into catheters to increase the accuracy of angiography. In addition, new types of noninvasive imaging devices are being developed that detect functional brain activity through changes in tissue light emission or reflectance.

But for too many of us this triumph of immune system over virus is temporary. The virus has <u>not</u> been destroyed but remains dormant in our nerve cells, ready to strike again later in life. This second eruption of the chickenpox virus is the disease called shingles or herpes zoster.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:128}}</p>\n\n<p>Most adults who have the dormant virus in their body never get shingles. The disease occurs when an unknown trigger causes the virus to become activated.</p>\n\n<p>You <u>cannot</u> develop shingles unless you have had an earlier exposure to chickenpox. The disease most often strikes <i>after</i> age 50. But since shingles is so common, affecting an estimated one million people in the United States each year, cases in young people are not rare. Most people who get shingles have it only once, but it is possible for the outbreak to appear again.</p>\n\n<h1>Types of Herpes Viruses</h1>\n<p>Scientists call the virus that causes chickenpox/shingles varicella-zoster virus or VZV. The word “varicella” is derived from variola, the Latin word for smallpox, another infectious disease that can resemble chickenpox.  “Zoster” is the Greek word for girdle; shingles often produces a girdle or belt of blisters or lesions around one side of the waist. This striking pattern also underlies the condition\'s common name: shingles comes from cingulum, the Latin word for belt or girdle.</p>\n\n<p>VZV belongs to a group of viruses called herpesviruses. This group includes the herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores, fever blisters, mononucleosis, genital herpes, and Epstein-Barr virus involved in infectious mononucleosis. Like VZV, other herpesviruses can hide in the nervous system after an initial infection and then travel down nerve cell fibers to cause a renewed infection. Repeated episodes of cold sores on the lips are the most common example.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:136}}</p>\n\n<p>As early as 1909, scientists suspected that the viruses causing chickenpox and shingles were one and the same. In the 1920s and 1930s, the case was strengthened by an experiment in which children were inoculated with fluid from shingles blisters. Within 2 weeks, about half of the children developed chickenpox. Finally, in 1958, detailed analyses of the viruses taken from patients with either chickenpox or shingles confirmed that the viruses were identical.</p>\n\n<p>Virtually all adults in the United States have had chickenpox, even if it was so mild as to pass unnoticed, and thus may develop shingles later in life. In the original exposure to VZV (chickenpox), some of the virus particles leave the blood and settle into clusters of neurons called sensory ganglia, where they remain for many years in an inactive (latent) form. The sensory ganglia, which are adjacent to the spinal cord and brain, relay information to the brain about what the body is sensing—heat, cold, touch, pain.</p>\n\n<p>When the VZV reactivates, it spreads down the axons that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the telltale rash erupts, and the person now has herpes zoster, or shingles. With shingles, the nervous system is more deeply involved than it was during the bout with chickenpox, and the symptoms are often more complex and severe.</p>', 1, 301, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(51, 'ds-b02_02', '<h2>Incidence and Prevalence</h2><p>About 25 percent of all adults, mostly otherwise healthy, will get shingles during their lifetimes, usually after age 50. The incidence increases with age so that shingles is 10 times more likely to occur in adults over 60 than in children under 10. The "burden of illness" (a measure of severity of zoster pain) is double among individuals greater than age 70 as compared to those 60-69 years old.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:137}}</p>\n\n<p>People with compromised immune systems—from use of immunosuppressive medications such as prednisone, from serious illnesses such as cancer, or from infection with HIV—are at increased risk of developing shingles. Shingles is also common in people who are under prolonged stress. These individuals also can have re-eruptions and some may have shingles that never heals. Most people who get shingles re-boost their immunity to VZV and will not get the disease for another few decades.</p>\n\n<p>Youngsters whose mothers had chickenpox late in pregnancy—5 to 21 days before giving birth—or who had chickenpox in infancy, have an increased risk of pediatric shingles. Sometimes these children are born with chickenpox or develop a typical case within a few days.</p>\n\n<p>Chickenpox and shingles are caused by the same virus—varicella zoster (VZV). When a person, usually a child, has not received the chickenpox vaccine (which became available in the United States in 1995) is exposed to VZV, he or she usually develops chickenpox, a highly contagious disease that can be spread by breathing as well as by contact with the rash. The infection begins in the upper respiratory tract where the virus incubates for 15 days or more. VZV then spreads to the bloodstream and migrates to the skin, giving rise to the familiar chickenpox rash.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, you <u>can\'t</u> catch shingles from someone else. You must already have been exposed to chickenpox and harbor the virus in your nervous system to develop shingles. When reactivated, the virus travels down nerves to the skin, causing the painful shingles rash. In shingles, the virus does not normally spread to the bloodstream or lungs, so the virus is <u>not</u> shed in air. Because the shingles rash contains active virus particles, someone who has never had chickenpox can catch it from exposure to a shingles rash.</p>\n\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms for Herpes Zoster</h2>\n\n<pThe first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain, or itch, in one particular location on only one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters appears. These are similar to chickenpox but appear in a cluster rather than scattered over the body. The cluster typically appears in one area on one side of the body. Recent studies have shown that subtle cases of shingles with only a few blisters, or none, are more common than previously thought. These cases may remain unrecognized. Cases without any known lesions are known as zoster sine herpete.</p>\n\n<p>Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. The second most common location is on one side of the face around the eye and on the forehead. However, shingles can involve any part of the body. The number of blisters or lesions is variable. Some rashes merge and produce an area that looks like a severe burn. Other patients may have just a few scattered lesions that don\'t cause severe symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>For most healthy people, shingles rashes heal within a few weeks, the pain and itch that accompany the lesions subside, and the blisters leave no scars. Other people may have sensory symptoms that linger for a few months. </p>', 2, 208, 1, NULL, NULL),

Early treatment can reduce or prevent severe pain and help blisters dry faster. Antiviral drugs can reduce by about half the risk of being left with postherpetic neuralgia, which is chronic pain that can last for months or years after the shingles rash clears.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:321}}</p>\n\n<p>Doctors recommend starting antiviral drugs at the first sign of the shingles rash, or even if the telltale symptoms indicate that a rash is about to erupt. Even if a patient is not seen by a doctor at the beginning of the illness, it may still be useful to start antiviral medications if new lesions are forming. It is important not to miss any doses or stop taking the medication early. Other treatments to consider are anti-inflammatory corticosteroids such as prednisone. These are routinely used when the eye or other facial nerves are affected. Most people with shingles can be treated at home.</p>\n\n<p>People with shingles should also try to relax and reduce stress (stress can make pain worse and lead to depression); eat regular, well-balanced meals; and perform gentle exercises, such as walking or stretching to keep active and stop thinking about the pain (they should check with their doctor first).  Placing a cool, damp washcloth on the blisters—but not when wearing a topical cream or patch—can help blisters dry faster and relieve pain.</p>\n\n<h2>Contracting Herpes Zoster</h2>\n\n<p>Shingles is <u>not</u> contagious—it can\'t be "caught" from someone else.

Not enough data currently exists to indicate whether shingles can occur later in life in a person who was vaccinated against chickenpox.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:322}}</p>\n\n<h3>Shingles Vaccine</h3>\n\n<p>In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a VZV vaccine (Zostavax®) for use in people 60 and older who have had chickenpox. In March 2011, the FDA extended the approval to include adults 50-59 as well. Zostavax® is a live virus vaccine. It can be administered concurrently with all other live and inactivated vaccines, including those routinely recommended for persons in 60 years and older age group, such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:140}}</p>\n\n<p>Researchers found that giving older adults the vaccine reduced the expected number of cases of shingles by half. And in people who still got the disease despite immunization, the severity and complications of shingles were dramatically reduced. The Shingles Prevention Study—a collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Merck & Co., Inc.—involved more than 38,000 veterans aged 60 and older. The purpose was to find out how safe the vaccine is, and if it can prevent shingles. Half the study participants were vaccinated with a more potent version of the chickenpox vaccine, developed specifically for use in adults, and half received a placebo vaccine. Neither volunteers nor researchers knew if a particular subject had gotten the active or placebo vaccine until after the end of the study (a double-blind study).</p>\n\n<p>During more than 3 years of follow up, the vaccine reduced shingles cases by 51 percent; 642 cases of shingles developed in the placebo group compared with only 315 in the vaccinated group. Pain and discomfort were reduced by 61 percent in people who received the active vaccine but still got shingles. The vaccine also reduced the number of cases of postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds compared with the placebo.</p>\n\n<p>The shingles vaccine is a preventive therapy and not a treatment for those who already have shingles or postherpetic neuralgia. Zoster vaccine should be given regardless of a history of shingles. Shingles does recur, and there is no biological or epidemiological evidence to indicate that persons are at reduced risk for shingles for any period of time following a prior episode of shingles.</p>', 4, 196, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(54, 'ds-b02_05', '<h1>Postherpetic Neuralgia</h1><p>Sometimes, particularly in older people, shingles pain persists long after the rash has healed. This postherpetic neuralgia can be mild or severe—the most severe cases can lead to insomnia, weight loss, depression, and disability. Postherpetic neuralgia is not directly life-threatening. About a dozen medications in four categories have been shown in clinical trials to provide some pain relief. These include:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue"><ol>\n	<li><b>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):</b> TCAs are often the first type of drug given to patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia. The TCA amitriptyline was commonly prescribed in the past, but although effective, it has a high rate of side effects. Desipramine and nortriptyline have fewer side effects and are better choices for older adults, the most likely group to have postherpetic neuralgia. Common side effects of TCAs include dry eyes and mouth, constipation, and grogginess. People with heart arrhythmias, previous heart attacks, or narrow angle glaucoma should usually use a different class of drugs.\n	<li><b>Anticonvulsants:</b> Some drugs that reduce seizures can also treat postherpetic neuralgia because seizures and pain both involve abnormally increased firing of nerve cells. The antiseizure medication gabapentin is most often prescribed; carbamazepine is effective for postherpetic neuralgia but has rare, potentially dangerous side effects, including drowsiness or confusion, dizziness, and sometimes ankle swelling.\n	<li><b>Opioids:</b> Opioids are strong pain medications used for all types of pain. They include oxycodone, morphine, tramadol, and methadone. Opioids can have side effects—including drowsiness, mental dulling, and constipation—and can be addictive, so their use must be monitored carefully in those with a history of addiction.\n	<li><b>Topical local anesthetics:</b> Local anesthetics applied directly to the skin of the painful area affected by postherpetic neuralgia are also effective. Lidocaine, the most commonly prescribed, is available in cream, gel, or spray form. It is also available in a patch that has been approved by the FDA for use specifically in postherpetic neuralgia. Topical local anesthetics stay in the skin and therefore do not cause problems such as drowsiness or constipation. Capsaicin cream may be somewhat effective and is available over the counter, but most people find that it causes severe burning pain during application.\n</ol></div>\n\n<h2>Postherpetic Itch</h2>\n\n<p>The itch that sometimes occurs during or after shingles can be quite severe and painful. Clinical experience suggests that postherpetic itch is harder to treat than postherpetic neuralgia. Topical local anesthetics provide substantial relief to some patients. Since postherpetic itch typically develops in skin that has severe sensory loss, it is particularly important to avoid scratching. Scratching numb skin too long or too hard can cause injury.</p>\n\n<h1>Other Complications of Herpes Zoster</h1>\n\n<p>People with ophthalmic shingles—lesions in or around the eye and forehead—can suffer painful eye infections, and in some cases immediate or delayed vision loss which may be temporary or permanent. People with shingles in or near the eye should see an ophthalmologist immediately. Shingles infections within or near the ear (herpes zoster oticus or Ramsay-Hunt syndrome) can cause hearing or balance problems as well as weakness of the muscles on the affected side of the face. In rare cases, shingles can spread into the brain or spinal cord and cause serious complications such as stroke or meningitis. People with shingles need to seek immediate medical evaluation if they notice neurological symptoms outside the region of the primary shingles attack. People who are immunosuppressed, whether from diseases such as HIV or medications, have an increased risk of serious complications from shingles. Most commonly, they get shingles that spreads to involve more parts of the body, or shingles rashes that persist for long periods or return frequently. Many such patients are helped by taking antiviral medications on a continuous basis.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:141}}</p>', 5, 266, 1, NULL, NULL),

VZV infection during pregnancy poses some risk to the unborn child, depending upon the stage of pregnancy. During the first 30 weeks, maternal chickenpox may, in some cases, lead to congenital malformations. Such cases are rare and experts differ in their opinions on how great the risk is. Most experts agree that shingles in a pregnant woman, a rare event, is even less likely to cause harm to the unborn child.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:320}}</p>\n\n<p>If a pregnant woman gets chickenpox between 21 to 5 days before giving birth, her newborn can have chickenpox at birth or develop it within a few days. But the time lapse between the start of the mother\'s illness and the birth of the baby generally allows the mother\'s immune system to react and produce antibodies to fight the virus. These antibodies can be transmitted to the unborn child and thus help fight the infection. Still, a small percent of the babies exposed to chickenpox in the 21 to 5 days before birth develop shingles in the first 5 years of life because the newborn\'s immune system is not yet fully functional and capable of keeping the virus latent.</p>\n\n<p>If the mother contracts chickenpox at the time of birth, the mother\'s immune system has <u>not</u> had a chance to mobilize its forces. And although some of the mother\'s antibodies will be transmitted to the newborn via the placenta, the newborn will have little ability to fight off the attack because its immune system is immature. If these babies develop chickenpox as a result, it can be fatal. They are given zoster immune globulin, a preparation made from the antibody-rich blood of adults who have recently recovered from chickenpox or shingles, to lessen the severity of their chickenpox.</p>', 6, 123, 1, NULL, NULL),

HIV can enter the body through the lining of the vagina, penis, mouth, rectum or vulva during sex.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to remember that HIV can be transmitted to and infect anyone who practices risky behaviors such as:</p>\r\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sharing drug needles or syringes</li>\r\n	<li>Having sexual contact, including oral sexual contact, with an infected person without using a condom</li>\r\n	<li>Having sexual contact with someone whose HIV status is unknown</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Prior to the screening of blood products for evidence of HIV and prior to the introduction of certain techniques to destroy HIV in blood products in 1985, HIV was transmitted through transfusions of HIV contaminated blood or blood products. Today, due to the advances in technology in treating blood products, risk of acquiring HIV from blood and blood products is an extremely rare event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HIV is often spread among injection drug users when they share needles or syringes contaminated with very small quantities of blood from someone infected with the virus. It is rare for a patient to be the source of HIV transmitted to a healthcare provider or vice versa by accidental sticks with contaminated needles or other medical instruments.</p>\n\n<p>HIV infection can also be transmitted by women to their fetuses transplacentally during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, or, shortly thereafter through breastfeeding.

Treatment, called antiretroviral therapy, works best when it is used early in pregnancy and when it is also given during labor and delivery and to the infant after birth. A pregnant woman may be tested for HIV again later in pregnancy if she is at high-risk. Starting treatment later in pregnancy, during childbirth, and giving the newborn baby an anti-HIV drug after birth, can also lower the risk of a mother passing HIV to her baby.

The virus slowly disables or destroys these cells without causing symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the immune system becomes more debilitated, a variety of complications start to take over. For many people, the first signs of infection are large lymph nodes, or swollen glands that may be enlarged for more than 3 months.</p>\n\n<p><b>Later Symptoms</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the late stages of HIV infection, the virus severely weakens the immune system, and people infected with the virus may have the following symptoms:</p>\r\n<div class="callout callout-green">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rapid weight loss\r<li>Recurring fever or profuse night sweats</li>\r<li>Extreme and unexplained tiredness</li>\r<li>Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck</li>\r<li>Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week</li>\r<li>Sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals</li>\r<li>Pneumonia</li>\r<li>Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids</li>\r<li>Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders</li>\r\n</ul></div>\r\n<p>Each of these symptoms can be related to other illnesses. The only way to find out if you are infected with HIV is to get tested.</p>\r\n<p>Some people develop frequent and severe herpes infections that cause mouth, genital, or anal sores, or a painful nerve disease known as shingles. Children may have delayed development or failure to thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People with AIDS are also particularly prone to developing various cancers, especially those caused by viruses such as Kaposi\'s sarcoma and cervical cancer, or cancers of the immune system known as lymphomas. These cancers are usually more aggressive and difficult to treat in people with AIDS. Signs of Kaposi\'s sarcoma in light-skinned people are round brown, reddish, or purple spots that develop in the skin or in the mouth. In dark-skinned people, the spots are more pigmented.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:191}}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC estimates that 1,144,500 persons aged 13 years and older are living with HIV infection, including 180,900 (15.8%) who are unaware of their infection. Over the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, while the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable. Still, the pace of new infections continues at far too high a level—particularly among certain groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimated incidence of HIV has remained stable overall in recent years, at about 50,000 new HIV infections per year. Within the overall estimates, however, some groups are affected more than others. Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to bear the greatest burden of HIV infection, and among races/ethnicities, African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the health care setting, workers have been infected with HIV after being stuck with needles containing HIV-infected blood or, less frequently, after infected blood gets into a worker’s open cut or a mucous membrane (for example, the eyes or inside of the nose). There has been only one instance of patients being infected by a health care worker in the United States; this involved HIV transmission from one infected dentist to six patients. Investigations have been completed involving more than 22,000 patients of 63 HIV-infected physicians, surgeons, and dentists, and no other cases of this type of transmission have been identified in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>As of 2010, 57 documented occupational transmissions and 143 possible transmissions had been reported in the United States. The most recent possible new case of occupationally acquired HIV reported to CDC occurred in 2009; no new documented cases have been reported since 1999, although several cases are currently in various stages of investigation. Underreporting of cases to CDC is possible, however, because case reporting is voluntary. Health care workers who are exposed to HIV-infected blood at work have a 0.3% risk of becoming infected. In other words, 3 of every 1,000 such injuries, if untreated, will result in infection. Occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers is extremely rare.</p>', 8, 353, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(63, 'oc0100_09', '<h2>Viral Hemorrhagic Fever</h2><p>Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term "viral hemorrhagic fever" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). Characteristically, the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body\'s ability to regulate itself is impaired. These symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage; however, the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. While some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these viruses cause severe, life-threatening disease.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:192}}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viruses associated with most VHFs are zoonotic. This means that these viruses naturally reside in an animal reservoir host or arthropod vector. They are totally dependent on their hosts for replication and overall survival. For the most part, rodents and arthropods are the main reservoirs for viruses causing VHFs. The multimammate rat, cotton rat, deer mouse, house mouse, and other field rodents are examples of reservoir hosts. Arthropod ticks and mosquitoes serve as vectors for some of the illnesses. However, the hosts of some viruses remain unknown—Ebola and Marburg viruses are well-known examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, the viruses that cause VHFs are distributed over much of the globe. However, because each virus is associated with one or more particular host species, the virus and the disease it causes are usually seen only where the host species live(s). Some hosts, such as the rodent species carrying several of the New World arenaviruses, live in geographically restricted areas. Therefore, the risk of getting VHFs caused by these viruses is restricted to those areas. Other hosts range over continents, such as the rodents that carry viruses which cause various forms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North and South America, or the different set of rodents that carry viruses which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. A few hosts are distributed nearly worldwide, such as the common rat. It can carry Seoul virus, a cause of HFRS; therefore, humans can get HFRS anywhere where the common rat is found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While people usually become infected only in areas where the host lives, occasionally people become infected by a host that has been exported from its native habitat. For example, the first outbreaks of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Yugoslavia, occurred when laboratory workers handled imported monkeys infected with Marburg virus. Occasionally, a person becomes infected in an area where the virus occurs naturally and then travels elsewhere. If the virus is a type that can be transmitted further by person-to-person contact, the traveler could infect other people. For instance, in 1996, a medical professional treating patients with Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebola HF) in Gabon unknowingly became infected. When he later traveled to South Africa and was treated for Ebola HF in a hospital, the virus was transmitted to a nurse. She became ill and died. Because more and more people travel each year, outbreaks of these diseases are becoming an increasing threat in places where they rarely, if ever, have been seen before.</p>\r\n', 9, 230, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(64, 'oc0100_10', '<h3>VHF Transmission</h3><p>Viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. The viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine, fecal matter, saliva, or other body excretions from infected rodents. The viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human, or when a human crushes a tick. However, some of these vectors may spread virus to animals, livestock, for example. Humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:433}}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another, once an initial person has become infected. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. This type of secondary transmission of the virus can occur directly, through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. It can also occur indirectly, through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. For example, contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>VHF Signs and Symptoms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength, and exhaustion. Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from body orifices like the mouth, eyes, or ears. However, although they may bleed from many sites around the body, patients rarely die because of blood loss. Severely ill patient cases may also show shock, nervous system malfunction, coma, delirium, and seizures. Some types of VHF are associated with renal (kidney) failure.</p>', 10, 129, 1, NULL, NULL),

Also known as a berry aneurysm (because it resembles a berry hanging from a vine), this most common form of cerebral aneurysm is typically found on arteries at the base of the brain. Saccular aneurysms occur most often in adults.</li>\n	<li>\n		A <i>lateral aneurysm</i> appears as a bulge on one wall of the blood vessel.</li>\n	<li>\n		A <i>fusiform aneurysm</i> is formed by the widening along all walls of the vessel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	Aneurysms are also classified by size. Small aneurysms are less than 11 millimeters in diameter (about the size of a standard pencil eraser), larger aneurysms are 11-25 millimeters (about the width of a dime), and giant aneurysms are greater than 25 millimeters in diameter (more than the width of a quarter).</p>\n<h2>\n	Risks for Aneurysm</h2>\n<p>\n	Brain aneurysms can occur in anyone, at any age. They are more common in adults than in children and slightly more common in women than in men. People with certain inherited disorders are also at higher risk.</p>\n\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:100}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	<i>All</i> cerebral aneurysms have the potential to rupture and cause bleeding within the brain.

	(75, 'ds-i60_03', '<h2>Symptoms of Aneurysms</h2><p>Most cerebral aneurysms do not show symptoms until they either become very large or burst. Small, unchanging aneurysms generally will <u>not</u> produce symptoms, whereas a larger aneurysm that is steadily growing may press on tissues and nerves. Symptoms may include pain above and behind the eye; numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the face; dilated pupils; and vision changes. When an aneurysm hemorrhages, an individual may experience a sudden and extremely severe headache, double vision, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and/or loss of consciousness. Patients usually describe the headache as “the worst headache of my life” and it is generally different in severity and intensity from other headaches patients may have experienced. “Sentinel” or warning headaches may result from an aneurysm that leaks for days to weeks prior to rupture. Only a minority of patients has a sentinel headache prior to aneurysm rupture.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:101}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Other signs that a cerebral aneurysm has burst include nausea and vomiting associated with a severe headache, a drooping eyelid, sensitivity to light, and change in mental status or level of awareness. Some individuals may have seizures. Individuals may lose consciousness briefly or go into prolonged coma. People experiencing this “worst headache,” especially when it is combined with any other symptoms, should seek immediate medical attention.</p>\n<h2>\n	Diagnosing Cerebral Aneurysms</h2>\n<p>\n	Most cerebral aneurysms go unnoticed until they rupture or are detected by brain imaging that may have been obtained for another condition. Several diagnostic methods are available to provide information about the aneurysm and the best form of treatment. The tests are usually obtained after a subarachnoid hemorrhage to confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm.</p>\n<h3>\n	Angiography</h3>\n<p>\n	Angiography is a dye test used to analyze the arteries or veins. An intracerebral angiogram can detect the degree of narrowing or obstruction of an artery or blood vessel in the brain, head, or neck, and can identify changes in an artery or vein such as a weak spot like an aneurysm. It is used to diagnose stroke and to precisely determine the location, size, and shape of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or blood vessel that has bled. This test is usually performed in a hospital angiography suite. Following the injection of a local anesthetic, a flexible catheter is inserted into an artery and threaded through the body to the affected artery. A small amount of contrast dye (one that is highlighted on x-rays) is released into the bloodstream and allowed to travel into the head and neck. A series of x-rays is taken and changes, if present, are noted.</p>\n<h3>\n	Computed Tomography</h3>\n<p>\n	Computed tomography (CT) of the head is a fast, painless, noninvasive diagnostic tool that can reveal the presence of a cerebral aneurysm and determine, for those aneurysms that have burst, if blood has leaked into the brain. <i>This is often the first diagnostic procedure ordered by a physician following suspected rupture.</i> A computer processes X-rays of the head as two-dimensional cross-sectional images, or “slices,” of the brain and skull. Occasionally a contrast dye is injected into the bloodstream prior to scanning. This process, called CT angiography, produces sharper, more detailed images of blood flow in the brain arteries. CT is usually conducted at a testing facility or hospital outpatient setting.</p>\n', 3, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(76, 'ds-i60_04', '<h3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h3><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses computer-generated radio waves and a powerful magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain and other body structures.

Following application of a local anesthetic, a small amount of this fluid (which protects the brain and spinal cord) is removed from the subarachnoid space (located between the spinal cord and the membranes that surround it) by surgical needle and tested to detect any bleeding or brain hemorrhage. In patients with suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage, this procedure is usually done in a hospital.</p>\n<h2>\n	Cerebral Aneurysm Treatment</h2>\n<p>\n	Not all cerebral aneurysms burst. Some patients with very small aneurysms may be monitored to detect any growth or onset of symptoms and to ensure aggressive treatment of coexisting medical problems and risk factors. Each case is unique, and considerations for treating an unruptured aneurysm include the type, size, and location of the aneurysm; risk of rupture; patient’s age, health, and personal and family medical history; and risk of treatment.</p>\n<p>\n	<i>Two</i> surgical options are available for treating cerebral aneurysms, both of which carry some risk to the patient (such as possible damage to other blood vessels, the potential for aneurysm recurrence and rebleeding, and the risk of post-operative stroke).</p>\n<p>\n	<i>Microvascular clipping</i> involves cutting off the flow of blood to the aneurysm. Under anesthesia, a section of the skull is removed and the aneurysm is located. The <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_228">neurosurgeon</span> uses a microscope to isolate the blood vessel that feeds the aneurysm and places a small, metal, clothespin-like clip on the aneurysm’s neck, halting its blood supply. The clip remains in the patient and prevents the risk of future bleeding. The piece of the skull is then replaced and the scalp is closed. Clipping has been shown to be highly effective, depending on the location, shape, and size of the aneurysm. In general, aneurysms that are completely clipped surgically do <u>not</u> return.</p>\n<p>\n	A related procedure is an <i>occlusion</i> in which the surgeon clamps off (occludes) the entire artery that leads to the aneurysm. This procedure is often performed when the aneurysm has damaged the artery. An <i>occlusion</i> is sometimes accompanied by a <i>bypass</i> in which a small blood vessel is surgically grafted to the brain artery, rerouting the flow of blood away from the section of the damaged artery.</p>\n<p>\n	<i>Endovascular embolization</i> is an alternative to surgery. Once the patient has been anesthetized, the doctor inserts a hollow plastic tube (a catheter) into an artery (usually in the groin) and threads it, using <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_130">angiography</span>, through the body to the site of the aneurysm. Using a guide wire, detachable coils (spirals of platinum wire) or small latex balloons are passed through the catheter and released into the aneurysm. The coils or balloons fill the aneurysm, block it from circulation, and cause the blood to clot, which effectively destroys the aneurysm. The procedure may need to be performed more than once during the patient’s lifetime.</p>\n<p>\n	Patients who receive treatment for aneurysm must remain in bed until the bleeding stops. Underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure, should be treated. Other treatments for cerebral aneurysm are symptomatic and may include <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_217">anticonvulsants</span> to prevent seizures and analgesics to treat headache. Vasospasm can be treated with <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_220">calcium channel-blocking drugs</span> and sedatives may be ordered if the patient is restless. A <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_203">shunt</span> may be surgically inserted into a <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_234">ventricle</span> several months following rupture if the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid is causing harmful pressure on surrounding tissue.

	(79, 'ds-g80_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>In the 1860s, an English surgeon named William Little wrote the first medical descriptions of a puzzling disorder that struck children in the first years of life, causing stiff, spastic muscles in their legs and, to a lesser degree, in their arms. These children had difficulty grasping objects, crawling, and walking. Unlike most other diseases that affect the brain, this condition didn’t get worse as the children grew older. Instead, their disabilities stayed relatively the same. The disorder, which was called Little\'s disease for many years, is now known as spastic diplegia. It is one of a group of disorders that affect the control of movement and are gathered under the umbrella term of “cerebral palsy.”</p>\n<p>Because it seemed that many of Little’s patients were born following premature or complicated deliveries, the doctor suggested their condition was the result of oxygen deprivation during birth, which damaged sensitive brain tissues controlling movement. But in 1897, the famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud disagreed. Noting that children with cerebral palsy often had other neurological problems such as mental retardation, visual disturbances, and seizures, Freud suggested that the disorder might have roots earlier in life, during the brain\'s development in the womb. "Difficult birth, in certain cases," he wrote, "is merely a symptom of deeper effects that influence the development of the fetus."</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:80}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{COURSE_IMAGE:81}}</p>\n\n\n<p>In spite of Freud’s observation, for many decades the belief that birth complications caused most cases of cerebral palsy was widespread among physicians, families, and even medical researchers. In the 1980s, however, scientists funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) analyzed extensive data from more than 35,000 newborns and their mothers, and discovered that complications during birth and labor accounted for only a fraction of the infants born with cerebral palsy (probably less than 10 percent). In most cases, they could find no single, obvious cause. This finding challenged the accepted medical theory about the cause of cerebral palsy. It also stimulated researchers to search for other factors before, during, and after birth that were associated with the disorder.</p>\n<p>Advances in imaging technology, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have given researchers a way to look into the brains of infants and children with cerebral palsy and discover unique structural malformations and areas of damage.

	(81, 'ds-g80_03', '<h2>Incidence of Cerebral Palsy</h2><p>The United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) Foundation estimates that nearly 800,000 children and adults in the United States are living with one or more of the symptoms of cerebral palsy. According to the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year about 10,000 babies born in the United States will develop cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>\n	Despite advances in preventing and treating certain causes of cerebral palsy, the percentage of babies who develop the condition has <i>remained the same</i> over the past 30 years. Improved care in neonatal intensive care units has resulted in higher survival rates for very low birth weight babies. Many of these infants will have developmental defects in their nervous systems or suffer brain damage that will cause the characteristic symptoms of cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h2>\n	Early Signs of Cerebral Palsy</h2>\n<p>\n	The early signs of cerebral palsy usually appear before a child reaches 3 years of age. Parents are often the first to suspect that their baby’s motor skills aren’t developing normally. Infants with cerebral palsy frequently have <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_39">developmental delay</span>, in which they are slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, smile, or walk. Some infants with cerebral palsy have abnormal muscle tone as infants. <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_55">Hypotonia</span> can make them appear relaxed, even floppy. <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_54">Hypertonia</span> can make them seem stiff or rigid. In some cases, an early period of hypotonia will progress to hypertonia after the first 2 to 3 months of life. Children with cerebral palsy may also have unusual posture or favor one side of the body when they move.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:83}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Parents who are concerned about their baby\'s development for any reason should be referred to their pediatrician. A doctor can determine the difference between a normal lag in development and a delay that could indicate cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h2>\n	Causes of Cerebral Palsy</h2>\n<p>\n	The majority of children with cerebral palsy are born with it, although it may not be detected until months or years later. This is called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_36">congenital cerebral palsy</span>. In the past, if doctors couldn’t identify another cause, they attributed most cases of congenital cerebral palsy to problems or complications during labor that caused <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_25">asphyxia</span> during birth. However, extensive research by NINDS scientists and others has shown that few babies who experience asphyxia during birth grow up to have cerebral palsy or any other neurological disorder. Birth complications, including asphyxia, are now estimated to account for only 5 to 10 percent of the babies born with congenital cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>\n	A small number of children have <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_22">acquired cerebral palsy</span>, which means the disorder begins <i>after</i> birth. In these cases, doctors can often pinpoint a specific reason for the problem, such as brain damage in the first few months or years of life, brain infections such as bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis, or head injury from a motor vehicle accident, a fall, or child abuse.</p>\n<p>\n	Research has provided a bigger and more accurate picture of the kinds of events that can happen during early fetal development, or just before, during, or after birth, that cause the particular types of brain damage that will result in congenital cerebral palsy. There are multiple reasons why cerebral palsy happens, e.g., as the result of genetic abnormalities, maternal infections or fevers, or fetal injury. But in all cases the disorder is the result of <i>four</i> types of brain damage that cause its characteristic symptoms.</p>\n<h3>\n	Types of Brain Damage</h3>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_78">Periventricular leukomalacia</span> (PVL) is damage to the white matter of the brain. The white matter of the brain is responsible for transmitting signals inside the brain and to the rest of the body. PVL describes a type of damage that looks like tiny holes in the white matter of an infant’s brain. These gaps in brain tissue interfere with the normal transmission of signals. There are a number of events that can cause PVL, including maternal or fetal infection. Researchers have also identified a period of <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_87">selective vulnerability</span> in the developing fetal brain, a period between 26 and 34 weeks of <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_50">gestation</span>, in which periventricular white matter is particularly sensitive to insults and injury.</p>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_32">Cerebral dysgenesis</span> is abnormal development of the brain. Any interruption of the normal process of brain growth during fetal development can cause brain malformations that interfere with the transmission of brain signals. The fetal brain is particularly vulnerable during the first 20 weeks of development. Mutations in the genes that control brain development during this early period can keep the brain from developing normally. Infections, fevers, trauma, or other conditions that cause unhealthy conditions in the womb also put an unborn baby’s nervous system at risk.</p>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_57">Intracranial hemorrhage</span> describes bleeding inside the brain caused by blocked or broken blood vessels. A common cause of this kind of damage is fetal stroke. Some babies suffer a stroke while still in the womb because of blood clots in the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_79">placenta</span> that block blood flow. Other types of fetal stroke are caused by malformed or weak blood vessels in the brain or by blood-clotting abnormalities. Maternal <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_311">hypertension</span> is a common medical disorder during pregnancy that has been known to cause fetal stroke. Maternal infection, especially <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_77">pelvic inflammatory disease</span>, has also been shown to increase the risk of fetal stroke.</p>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_56">Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</span> or <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_58">intrapartum asphyxia</span> is brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen in the brain. Asphyxia, a lack of oxygen in the brain caused by an interruption in breathing or poor oxygen supply, is common in babies due to the stress of labor and delivery. But even though a newborn’s blood is equipped to compensate for short-term low levels of oxygen, if the supply of oxygen is cut off or reduced for lengthy periods, an infant can develop a type of brain damage called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which destroys tissue in the cerebral motor cortex and other areas of the brain. This kind of damage can also be caused by severe maternal low blood pressure, rupture of the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_334">uterus</span>, detachment of the placenta, or problems involving the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_333">umbilical cord</span>.</p>\n', 3, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(82, 'ds-g80_04', '<h2>Risk Factors for Cerebral Palsy</h2><p>Just as there are particular types of brain damage that cause cerebral palsy, there are also certain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery that will increase a baby’s risk of being born with cerebral palsy. Research scientists have examined thousands of expectant mothers, followed them through childbirth, and monitored their children’s early neurological development to establish these risk factors. If a mother or her baby has any of these risk factors, it <i>doesn’t</i> mean that cerebral palsy is inevitable, but it does increase the chance for the kinds of brain damage that cause it.</p>\n<h3>\n	Low Birthweight and Premature Birth</h3>\n<p>\n	The risk of cerebral palsy is higher among babies who weigh less than 5½ pounds at birth or are born less than 37 weeks into pregnancy. The risk <i>increases</i> as birthweight <i>falls</i> or weeks of gestation <i>shorten.</i> Intensive care for premature infants has improved dramatically over the course of the past 30 years. Babies born extremely early are surviving, but with medical problems that can put them at risk for cerebral palsy. Although normal- or heavier-weight babies are at relatively low individual risk for cerebral palsy, term or near-term babies still make up half of the infants born with the condition.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:84}}</p>\n\n<h3>\n	Multiple Births</h3>\n<p>\n	Twins, triplets, and other multiple births—even those born at term—are linked to an increased risk of cerebral palsy. The death of a baby’s twin or triplet further increases the risk.</p>\n<h3>\n	Infections During Pregnancy</h3>\n<p>\n	Infectious diseases caused by viruses, such as <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_332">toxoplasmosis</span>, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_84">rubella</span>, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_159">cytomegalovirus</span>, and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_749">herpes</span>, can infect the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_337">womb</span> and placenta. Researchers currently think that maternal infection leads to elevated levels of immune system cells called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_38">cytokines</span> that circulate in the brain and blood of the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_747">fetus</span>. Cytokines respond to infection by triggering inflammation. Inflammation may then go on to cause central nervous system damage in an unborn baby. Maternal fever during pregnancy or delivery can also set off this kind of inflammatory response.</p>\n<h3>\n	Blood Type Incompatibility</h3>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_83">Rh incompatibility</span> is a condition that develops when a mother’s <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_327">Rh</span> blood type (either positive or negative) is different from the blood type of her baby. Because blood cells from the baby and mother mix during pregnancy, if a mother is negative and her baby positive, for example, the mother’s system won’t tolerate the presence of Rh-positive red blood cells. Her body will begin to make <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_239">antibodies</span> that will attack and kill her baby’s blood cells. Rh incompatibility is routinely tested for and treated in the United States, but conditions in other countries continue to keep blood type incompatibility a risk factor for cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h3>\n	Exposure to Toxic Substances</h3>\n<p>\n	Mothers who have been exposed to toxic substances during pregnancy, such as <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_315">methyl mercury</span>, are at a heightened risk of having a baby with cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h3>\n	Mothers with Thyroid Abnormalities, Mental Retardation, or Seizures</h3>\n<p>\n	Mothers with any of these conditions are slightly more likely to have a child with cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h3>\n	Labor and Delivery Medical Conditions</h3>\n<p>\n	There are also medical conditions during labor and delivery, and immediately after delivery, that act as warning signs for an increased risk of cerebral palsy. Knowing these warning signs helps doctors keep a close eye on children who face a higher risk. However, parents shouldn’t become too alarmed if their baby has one or more of these conditions at birth. Most of these children will not develop cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>\n	Warning signs include:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<b>Breech Presentation:</b> babies with cerebral palsy are more likely to be in a <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_748">breech</span> position instead of head first at the beginning of labor.</li>\n	<li>\n		<b>Complicated Labor and Delivery:</b> a baby who has vascular or respiratory problems during labor and delivery may already have suffered brain damage or abnormalities.</li>\n	<li>\n		<b>Small for Gestational Age (SGA):</b> babies born smaller than normal for their <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_50">gestational age</span> are at risk for cerebral palsy because of factors that kept them from growing naturally in the womb.</li>\n	<li>\n		<b>Low Apgar Score:</b> the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_23">Apgar</span> score is a numbered rating that reflects a newborn\'s condition. To determine an Apgar score, doctors periodically check a baby\'s heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflexes, and skin color during the first minutes after birth. They then assign points; the higher the score, the more normal a baby\'s condition. A low score at 10-20 minutes after delivery is often considered an important sign of potential problems such as cerebral palsy.</li>\n	<li>\n		<b>Jaundice:</b> more than 50 percent of newborns develop <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_61">jaundice</span> after birth when <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_28">bilirubin</span>, a substance normally found in <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_293">bile</span>, builds up faster than their livers can break it down and pass it from the body. Severe, untreated jaundice can cause a neurological condition known as <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_62">kernicterus</span>, which kills brain cells and can cause deafness and cerebral palsy.</li>\n	<li>\n		<b>Seizures:</b> an infant who has seizures faces a higher risk of being diagnosed later in childhood with cerebral palsy.</li>\n</ul>\n', 4, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(83, 'ds-g80_05', '<h2>Cerebral Palsy Prevention</h2><p>Cerebral palsy related to genetic abnormalities is <u>not</u> preventable, but a few of the risk factors for congenital cerebral palsy can be managed or avoided. For example, rubella is preventable if women are vaccinated against the disease <i>before</i> becoming pregnant. Rh incompatibilities can also be managed early in pregnancy. But there are still risk factors that can’t be controlled or avoided in spite of medical intervention.</p>\n<p>\n	For example, the use of electronic fetal monitoring machines to keep track of an unborn baby’s heartbeat during labor, and the use of emergency <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_297">cesarean section</span> surgery when there are significant signs of fetal distress, <i>haven’t</i> lowered the numbers of babies born with cerebral palsy. Interventions to treat other prenatal causes of cerebral palsy, such as therapies to prevent prenatal stroke or antibiotics to cure <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_60">intrauterine infections</span>, are either difficult to administer or haven’t yet been proven to lower the risk of cerebral palsy in vulnerable infants.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:85}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Fortunately, acquired cerebral palsy, often due to head injury, is preventable using common safety tactics, such as using car seats for infants and toddlers, and making sure young children wear helmets when they ride bicycles.

	(84, 'ds-g80_06', '<h2>Forms of Cerebral Palsy</h2><p>The specific forms of cerebral palsy are determined by the extent, type, and location of a child’s abnormalities. Doctors classify cerebral palsy according to the type of movement disorder involved: spastic (stiff muscles), <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_27">athetoid</span> (writhing movements), or ataxic (poor balance and coordination), plus any additional symptoms. Doctors will often describe the type of cerebral palsy a child has based on which limbs are affected. The names of the most common forms of cerebral palsy use Latin terms to describe the location or number of affected limbs, combined with the words for weakened (paresis) or paralyzed (plegia). For example, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_52">hemiparesis</span> (hemi = half) indicates that only one side of the body is weakened. <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_81">Quadriplegia</span> (quad = four) means all four limbs are paralyzed.</p>\n<h3>\n	Spastic Hemiplegia/Hemiparesis</h3>\n<p>\n	This type of cerebral palsy typically affects the arm and hand on one side of the body, but it can also include the leg. Children with <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_89">spastic hemiplegia</span> generally walk later and on tiptoes because of tight heel <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_328">tendons</span>. The arm and leg of the affected side are frequently shorter and thinner. Some children will develop <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_85">scoliosis</span>. Depending on the location of the brain damage, a child with spastic hemiplegia may also have seizures. Speech will be delayed and, at best, may be competent, but intelligence is usually normal.</p>\n<h3>\n	Spastic Diplegia/Diparesis</h3>\n<p>\n	In this type of cerebral palsy, muscle stiffness is predominantly in the legs and less severely affects the arms and face, although the hands may be clumsy. Children with <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_97">spastic diplegia</span> have tendon- reflexes that are hyperactive. Toes point up. Tightness in certain leg muscles makes the legs move like scissor blades. Children with this kind of cerebral palsy may require a walker or leg braces. Intelligence and language skills are usually normal.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:87}}</p>\n\n<h3>\n	Spastic Quadriplegia/Quadriparesis</h3>\n<p>\n	This is the <i>most severe</i> form of cerebral palsy, often associated with moderate-to-severe mental retardation. It is caused by widespread damage to the brain or significant brain malformations. Children with <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_90">spastic quadriplegia</span> will often have severe stiffness in their limbs but a floppy neck. They are rarely able to walk. Speaking and being understood are difficult. Seizures can be frequent and hard to control.</p>\n<h3>\n	Dyskinetic</h3>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_41">Dyskinetic</span> cerebral palsy that also includes athetoid, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_34">choreoathetoid</span>, and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_42">dystonic</span> cerebral palsies is the type of cerebral palsy characterized by slow and uncontrollable writhing movements of the hands, feet, arms, or legs. In some children, hyperactivity in the muscles of the face and tongue makes them grimace or drool. They find it difficult to sit straight or walk. Children may also have problems coordinating the muscle movements required for speaking. Intelligence is rarely affected in these forms of cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h3>\n	Ataxic Cerebral Palsy</h3>\n<p>\n	This rare type of cerebral palsy affects balance and depth perception. Children will often have poor coordination and walk unsteadily with a wide-based gait, placing their feet unusually far apart. They have difficulty with quick or precise movements, such as writing or buttoning a shirt. They may also have <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_312">intention tremor</span>, in which a voluntary movement, such as reaching for a book, is accompanied by trembling that gets worse the closer their hand gets to the object.</p>\n<h3>\n	Mixed Types</h3>\n<p>\n	It is common for children to have symptoms that don’t correspond to any single type of cerebral palsy. Their symptoms are a mix of types. For example, a child with mixed cerebral palsy may have some muscles that are too tight and others that are too relaxed, creating a mix of stiffness and floppiness.</p>\n', 6, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(85, 'ds-g80_07', '<h2>Other Associated Conditions</h2><p>Many individuals with cerebral palsy have no additional medical disorders. However, because cerebral palsy involves the brain and the brain controls so many of the body’s functions, cerebral palsy can also cause seizures, impair intellectual development, and affect vision, hearing, and behavior. Coping with these disabilities may be even more of a challenge than coping with the motor impairments of cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>\n	These additional medical conditions include:</p>\n<h3>\n	Mental Retardation</h3>\n<p>\n	Two-thirds of individuals with cerebral palsy will be intellectually impaired. Mental impairment is more common among those with spastic quadriplegia than in those with other types of cerebral palsy, and children who have epilepsy and an abnormal <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_43">electroencephalogram</span> (EEG) or MRI are also more likely to have mental retardation.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:88}}</p>\n\n<h3>\n	Seizure Disorder</h3>\n<p>\n	It is estimated that as many as half of all children with cerebral palsy have seizures. Seizures can take the form of the classic convulsions of <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_94">tonic-clonic seizures</span> or the less obvious <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_46">focal (partial) seizures</span>, in which the only symptoms may be muscle twitches or mental confusion.</p>\n<h3>\n	Delayed Growth and Development</h3>\n<p>\n	A syndrome called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_45">failure to thrive</span> is common in children with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, especially those with spastic <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_326">quadriparesis</span>. Failure to thrive is a general term doctors use to describe children who lag behind in growth and development. In babies this lag usually takes the form of too little weight gain. In young children it can appear as abnormal shortness, and in teenagers it may appear as a combination of shortness and lack of sexual development.</p>\n<p>\n	In addition, the muscles and limbs affected by cerebral palsy tend to be smaller than normal. This is especially noticeable in children with spastic hemiplegia because limbs on the affected side of the body may not grow as quickly or as long as those on the normal side.</p>\n<h3>\n	Spinal Deformities</h3>\n<p>\n	Deformities of the spine, e.g., curvature (<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_85">scoliosis</span>), humpback (<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_63">kyphosis</span>), and saddle back (<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_64">lordosis</span>) are associated with cerebral palsy. Spinal deformities can make sitting, standing, and walking difficult and cause chronic back pain.</p>\n<h3>\n	Impaired Vision, Hearing, or Speech</h3>\n<p>\n	A large number of children with cerebral palsy have <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_92">strabismus</span>, commonly called “cross eyes,” in which the eyes are misaligned because of differences between the left and right eye muscles. In an adult, strabismus causes double vision. In children, the brain adapts to the condition by ignoring signals from one of the misaligned eyes. Untreated, this can lead to poor vision in one eye and can interfere with the ability to judge distance. In some cases, doctors will recommend surgery to realign the muscles.</p>\n<p>\n	Children with hemiparesis may have <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_51">hemianopia</span>, which is defective vision or blindness that blurs the normal field of vision in one eye. In <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_53">homonymous</span> hemianopia, the impairment affects the same part of the visual field in both eyes.</p>\n<p>\n	Impaired hearing is also more frequent among those with cerebral palsy than in the general population. Speech and language disorders, such as difficulty forming words and speaking clearly, are present in more than a third of those with cerebral palsy.</p>\n<h3>\n	Drooling</h3>\n<p>\n	Some individuals with cerebral palsy drool because they have poor control of the muscles of the throat, mouth, and tongue. Drooling can cause severe skin irritation. Because it is socially unacceptable, drooling may also isolate children from their peers.</p>\n<h3>\n	Incontinence</h3>\n<p>\n	A common complication of cerebral palsy is <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_256">incontinence</span>, caused by poor control of the muscles that keep the bladder closed. Incontinence can take the form of bed-wetting, uncontrolled urination during physical activities, or slow leaking of urine throughout the day.</p>\n<h3>\n	Abnormal Sensations and Perceptions</h3>\n<p>\n	Some children with cerebral palsy have difficulty feeling simple sensations, such as touch. They may have <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_91">stereognosia</span>, which makes it difficult to perceive and identify objects using only the sense of touch. A child with stereognosia, for example, would have trouble closing his/her eyes and sensing the difference between a hard ball or a sponge ball that was placed in the hand.</p>\n', 7, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(86, 'ds-g80_08', '<h2>Diagnosing Cerebral Palsy</h2><p>Early signs of cerebral palsy may be present from birth. Most children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed during the first 2 years of life. But if a child’s symptoms are mild, it can be difficult for a doctor to make a reliable diagnosis before the age of 4 or 5. Nevertheless, if a doctor suspects cerebral palsy, he or she will most likely schedule an appointment to observe the child and talk to the parents about their child’s physical and behavioral development.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:89}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Doctors diagnose cerebral palsy by evaluating a child’s motor skills and taking a careful and thorough look at their medical history. In addition to checking for the most characteristic symptoms—slow development, abnormal muscle tone, and unusual posture—a doctor also has to rule out other disorders that could cause similar symptoms. Most important, a doctor has to determine that the child\'s condition is not getting worse. Although symptoms may change over time, cerebral palsy by definition is <u>not</u> progressive. If a child is continuously losing motor skills, the problem more likely begins elsewhere, e.g., genetic or muscle disease, metabolism disorder, or tumors in the nervous system. A comprehensive medical history, special diagnostic tests, and, in some cases, repeated check-ups can help confirm that other disorders are not at fault.</p>\n<p>\n	Additional tests are often used to rule out other movement disorders that could cause the same symptoms as cerebral palsy. Neuroimaging techniques that allow doctors to look into the brain can detect abnormalities that indicate a potentially treatable movement disorder. If it is cerebral palsy, an MRI scan can also show a doctor the location and type of brain damage.</p>\n<p>\n	Neuroimaging methods include:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Cranial <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_96">Ultrasound</span>: This test is used for high-risk premature infants because it is the least intrusive of the imaging techniques, although it is <u>not</u> as successful as the two methods described below at capturing subtle changes in white matter.</li>\n	<li>\n		<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_35">Computed Tomography (CT) Scan</span>: This technique creates images that show the structure of the brain and the areas of damage.</li>\n	<li>\n		<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_65">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan</span>: This test uses a computer, a magnetic field, and radio waves to create an anatomical picture of the brain\'s tissues and structures. Doctors prefer MRI imaging because it offers finer levels of detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	On rare occasions, metabolic disorders can masquerade as cerebral palsy and some children will require additional tests to rule them out. Most of the childhood metabolic disorders have characteristic brain abnormalities or malformations that will show up in an MRI.</p>\n<p>\n	Other types of disorders can also be mistaken for cerebral palsy. For example, coagulation disorders (which prevent blood from clotting) can cause <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_323">prenatal</span> or <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_320">perinatal</span> strokes that damage the brain and cause symptoms characteristic of cerebral palsy. Because stroke is so often the cause of hemiplegic cerebral palsy, a doctor may find it necessary to perform diagnostic testing on children with this kind of cerebral palsy to rule out the presence of a coagulation disorder. If left undiagnosed, coagulation disorders can cause additional strokes and more extensive brain damage.</p>\n<p>\n	To confirm a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, a doctor may refer a child to additional doctors with specialized knowledge and training, such as a child <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_193">neurologist</span>, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_300">developmental pediatrician</span>, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_316">ophthalmologist</span>, or <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_317">otologist</span>.

Once the diagnosis is made, and the type of cerebral palsy is determined, a team of health care professionals will work with a child and his or her parents to identify specific impairments and needs, and then develop an appropriate plan to address the core disabilities that affect the child’s quality of life.</p>\n<p>\n	A comprehensive management plan will pull in a combination of health professionals, which may include:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		physical therapy to improve walking and gait, stretch spastic muscles, and prevent deformities;</li>\n	<li>\n		occupational therapy to develop compensating tactics for everyday activities such as getting dressed, going to school, and participating in day-to-day activities;</li>\n	<li>\n		speech therapy to address swallowing disorders, speech impediments, and other obstacles to communication;</li>\n	<li>\n		counseling and behavioral therapy to address emotional and psychological needs and help children cope emotionally with their disabilities;</li>\n	<li>\n		drugs to control seizures, relax muscle spasms, and alleviate pain;</li>\n	<li>\n		surgery to correct anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles;</li>\n	<li>\n		braces and other <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_71">orthotic devices</span> to compensate for muscle imbalance, improve posture and walking, and increase independent mobility;</li>\n	<li>\n		mechanical aids such as wheelchairs and rolling walkers for individuals who are not independently mobile; and</li>\n	<li>\n		communication aids such as computers, voice synthesizers, or symbol boards to allow severely impaired individuals to communicate with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Doctors use tests and evaluation scales to determine a child’s level of disability, and then make decisions about the types of treatments and the best timing and strategy for interventions. Early intervention programs typically provide all the required therapies within a single treatment center. Centers also focus on parents’ needs, often offering support groups, babysitting services, and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_82">respite care</span>.</p>\n<p>\n	The members of the treatment team for a child with cerebral palsy will most likely include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		A <i>physician;</i> such as a pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, or pediatric physiatrist, who is trained to help developmentally disabled children. This doctor, who often acts as the leader of the treatment team, integrates the professional advice of all team members into a comprehensive treatment plan, makes sure the plan is implemented properly, and follows the child’s progress over a number of years.</li>\n	<li>\n		An <i>orthopedist;</i> a surgeon who specializes in treating the bones, muscles, tendons, and other parts of the skeletal system. An orthopedist is often brought in to diagnose and treat muscle problems associated with cerebral palsy.</li>\n	<li>\n		A <i>physical therapist;</i> that designs and puts into practice special exercise programs to improve strength and functional mobility.</li>\n	<li>\n		An <i>occupational therapist;</i> that teaches the skills necessary for day-to-day living, school, and work.</li>\n	<li>\n		A <i>speech and language pathologist;</i> who specializes in diagnosing and treating disabilities relating to difficulties with swallowing and communication.</li>\n	<li>\n		A <i>social worker;</i> which helps individuals and their families locate community assistance and education programs.</li>\n	<li>\n		A <i>psychologist;</i> who helps individuals and their families cope with the special stresses and demands of cerebral palsy. In some cases, psychologists may also oversee therapy to modify unhelpful or destructive behaviors.</li>\n	<li>\n		An <i>educator;</i> who may play an especially important role when mental retardation or learning disabilities present a challenge to education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Regardless of age or the types of therapy that are used, treatment doesn’t end when an individual with cerebral palsy leaves the treatment center. <i>Most of the work is done at home.</i> Members of the treatment team often act as coaches, giving parents and children techniques and strategies to practice at home. Studies have shown that family support and personal determination are two of the most important factors in helping individuals with cerebral palsy reach their long-term goals.</p>\n<p>\n	While mastering specific skills is an important focus of treatment on a day-to-day basis, the ultimate goal is to help children grow into adulthood with as much independence as possible.</p>\n<p>\n	As a child with cerebral palsy grows older, the need for therapy and the kinds of therapies required, as well as support services, will likely change. Counseling for emotional and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_324">psychological</span> challenges may be needed at any age, but is often most critical during <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_289">adolescence</span>. Depending on their physical and intellectual abilities, adults may need help finding attendants to care for them, a place to live, a job, and a way to get to their place of employment.</p>\n<p>\n	Addressing the needs of parents and caregivers is also an important component of the treatment plan. The well being of an individual with cerebral palsy depends upon the strength and well being of his or her family. For parents to accept a child’s disabilities and come to grips with the extent of their caregiving responsibilities will take time and support from health care professionals. Family-centered programs in hospitals and clinics and community-based organizations usually work together with families to help them make well-informed decisions about the services they need. They also coordinate services to get the most out of treatment.</p>\n<p>\n	A good program will encourage the open exchange of information, offer respectful and supportive care, encourage partnerships between parents and the health care professionals they work with, and acknowledge that although medical specialists may be the experts, it’s parents who know their children best.</p>\n', 9, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(88, 'ds-g80_10', '<h2>Cerebral Palsy Treatments</h2><p>Physical therapy, usually begun in the first few years of life or soon after the diagnosis is made, is a cornerstone of cerebral palsy treatment. Physical therapy programs use specific sets of exercises and activities to work toward two important goals: 1) preventing weakening or deterioration in the muscles that aren’t being used (<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_40">disuse atrophy</span>); 2) keeping muscles from becoming fixed in a rigid, abnormal position (contracture).</p>\n<p>\n	Resistive exercise programs (also called strength training) and other types of exercise are often used to increase muscle performance, especially in children and adolescents with mild cerebral palsy. Daily bouts of exercise keep muscles that aren’t normally used moving and active and less prone to wasting away. Exercise also reduces the risk of <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_37">contracture</span>, one of the most common and serious complications of cerebral palsy.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:91}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Normally growing children stretch their muscles and tendons as they run, walk, and move through their daily activities. This ensures that their muscles grow at the same rate as their bones. But in children with cerebral palsy, spasticity prevents muscles from stretching. As a result, their muscles don’t grow fast enough to keep up with their lengthening bones. The muscle contracture that results can set back the gains in function they’ve made. Physical therapy alone or in combination with special braces (called orthotic devices) helps prevent contracture by stretching spastic muscles.</p>\n<p>\n	Occupational therapy, this kind of therapy focuses on optimizing upper body function, improving posture, and making the most of a child’s mobility. An occupational therapist helps a child master the basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and using the bathroom alone. Fostering this kind of independence boosts self-reliance and self-esteem, and also helps reduce demands on parents and caregivers.</p>\n<p>\n	Recreational therapies, such as therapeutic horseback riding (also called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_310">hippotherapy</span>), are sometimes used with mildly impaired children to improve gross motor skills. Parents of children who participate in recreational therapies usually notice an improvement in their child’s speech, self-esteem, and emotional well being.</p>\n<p>\n	Controversial physical therapies, "Patterning" is a physical therapy based on the principle that children with cerebral palsy should be taught motor skills in the same sequence in which they develop in normal children. In this controversial approach, the therapist begins by teaching a child elementary movements such as crawling, regardless of age, before moving on to walking skills. Some experts and organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have expressed strong reservations about the patterning approach because studies have not documented its value.</p>\n<p>\n	Experts have similar reservations about the Bobath technique (which is also called “neurodevelopmental treatment”), named for a husband and wife team who pioneered the approach in England. In this form of physical therapy, instructors inhibit abnormal patterns of movement and encourage more normal movements.</p>\n<p>\n	The Bobath technique has had a widespread influence on the core physical therapies of cerebral palsy treatment, but there is no evidence that the technique improves motor control. The American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine reviewed studies that measured the impact of neurodevelopmental treatment and concluded that there was no strong evidence supporting its effectiveness for children with cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>\n	Conductive education; developed in Hungary in the 1940s, is another physical therapy that at one time appeared to hold promise. Conductive education instructors attempt to improve a child’s motor abilities by combining rhythmic activities, such as singing and clapping, with physical maneuvers on special equipment. The therapy, however, has not been able to produce consistent or significant improvements in study groups.</p>\n<p>\n	Speech and language therapy; about 20 percent of children with cerebral palsy are unable to produce intelligible speech. They also experience challenges in other areas of communication, such as hand gestures and facial expressions, and they have difficulty participating in the basic give and take of a normal conversation. These challenges will last throughout their lives.</p>\n<p>\n	Speech and language therapists (also known as speech therapists or speech-language pathologists) observe, diagnose, and treat the communication disorders associated with cerebral palsy. They use a program of exercises to teach children how to overcome specific communication difficulties.</p>\n<p>\n	For example, if a child has difficulty saying words that begin with "b," the therapist may suggest daily practice with a list of "b" words, increasing their difficulty as each list is mastered. Other kinds of exercises help children master the social skills involved in communicating by teaching them to keep their head up, maintain eye contact, and repeat themselves when they are misunderstood.</p>\n<p>\n	Speech therapists can also help children with severe disabilities learn how to use special communication devices, such as a computer with a voice synthesizer, or a special board covered with symbols of everyday objects and activities to which a child can point to indicate his or her wishes.</p>\n<p>\n	Speech interventions often use a child’s family members and friends to reinforce the lessons learned in a therapeutic setting. This kind of indirect therapy encourages people who are in close daily contact with a child to create opportunities for him or her to use their new skills in conversation.</p>\n<p>\n	Treatments for problems with eating and drooling are often necessary when children with cerebral palsy have difficulty eating and drinking because they have little control over the muscles that move their mouth, jaw, and tongue. They are also at risk for breathing food or fluid into the lungs. Some children develop <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_48">gastroesophageal reflux disease</span> (GERD), commonly called heartburn) in which a weak diaphragm can’t keep stomach acids from spilling into the esophagus. The irritation of the acid can cause bleeding and pain.</p>\n<p>\n	Individuals with cerebral palsy are also at risk for malnutrition, recurrent lung infections, and progressive lung disease. The individuals most at risk for these problems are those with spastic quadriplegia.</p>\n<p>\n	Initially, children should be evaluated for their swallowing ability, which is usually done with a modified <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_292">barium swallow</span> study. Recommendations regarding diet modifications will be derived from the results of this study.</p>\n<p>\n	In severe cases where swallowing problems are causing malnutrition, a doctor may recommend tube feeding, in which a tube delivers food and nutrients down the throat and into the stomach, or <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_49">gastrostomy</span>, in which a surgical opening allows a tube to be placed directly into the stomach.</p>\n<p>\n	Although numerous treatments for drooling have been tested over the years, there is no one treatment that helps reliably. <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_24">Anticholinergic drugs</span> such as <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_307">glycopyrrolate</span> can reduce the flow of saliva but may cause unpleasant side effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention. Surgery, while sometimes effective, carries the risk of complications. Some children benefit from biofeedback techniques that help them recognize more quickly when their mouths fall open and they begin to drool. Intraoral devices (devices that fit into the mouth) that encourage better tongue positioning and swallowing are still being evaluated, but appear to reduce drooling for some children.</p>\n', 10, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

These drugs are easy to use, except that dosages high enough to be effective often have side effects, among them drowsiness, upset stomach, high blood pressure, and possible liver damage with long-term use. Oral medications are most appropriate for children who need only mild reduction in muscle tone or who have widespread spasticity.</p>\n<p>\n	Doctors also sometimes use alcohol “washes” (injections of alcohol into muscles) to reduce spasticity.

BT-A injections work best for children who have some control over their motor movements and have a limited number of muscles to treat, none of which is fixed or rigid.</p>\n<p>\n	Because BT-A does not have FDA approval to treat spasticity in children, parents and caregivers should make sure that the doctor giving the injection is trained in the procedure and has experience using it in children.</p>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_59">Intrathecal baclofen</span> therapy uses an implantable pump to deliver baclofen, a muscle relaxant, into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord. Baclofen works by decreasing the excitability of nerve cells in the spinal cord, which then reduces muscle spasticity throughout the body. Because it is delivered directly into the nervous system, the intrathecal dose of baclofen can be as low as one one-hundredth of the oral dose. Studies have shown it reduces spasticity and pain and improves sleep.</p>\n<p>\n	The pump is the size of a hockey puck and is implanted in the abdomen. It contains a refillable reservoir connected to an alarm that beeps when the reservoir is low. The pump is programmable with an electronic <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_93">telemetry wand</span>. The program can be adjusted if muscle tone is worse at certain times of the day or night.</p>\n<p>\n	The baclofen pump carries a small but significant risk of serious complications if it fails or is programmed incorrectly (if the catheter becomes twisted or kinked) or if the insertion site becomes infected. Undesirable, but infrequent, side effects include over relaxation of the muscles, sleepiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and constipation.</p>\n<p>\n	As a muscle-relaxing therapy, the baclofen pump is most appropriate for individuals with chronic, severe stiffness or uncontrolled muscle movement throughout the body.

	(90, 'ds-g80_12', '<h2>Surgery</h2><p>Orthopedic surgery is often recommended when spasticity and stiffness are severe enough to make walking and moving about difficult or painful. For many people with cerebral palsy, improving the appearance of how they walk (their gait) is also important. A more upright gait with smoother transitions and foot placements is the primary goal for many children and young adults.</p>\n<p>\n	In the operating room, surgeons can lengthen muscles and tendons that are proportionately too short. But first, they have to determine the specific muscles responsible for the gait abnormalities. Finding these muscles can be difficult. It takes more than 30 major muscles working at the right time using the right amount of force to walk two strides with a normal gait. A problem with any of those muscles can cause an abnormal gait.</p>\n<p>\n	In addition, because the body makes natural adjustments to compensate for muscle imbalances, these adjustments could appear to be the problem, instead of a compensation. In the past, doctors relied on clinical examination, observation of the gait, and the measurement of motion and spasticity to determine the muscles involved. Now, doctors have a diagnostic technique known as <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_47">gait analysis</span>.</p>\n<p>\n	Gait analysis uses cameras that record how an individual walks, force plates that detect when and where feet touch the ground, a special recording technique that detects muscle activity (known as <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_44">electromyography</span>), and a computer program that gathers and analyzes the data to identify the problem muscles. Using gait analysis, doctors can precisely locate which muscles would benefit from surgery and how much improvement in gait can be expected.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:93}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	The timing of orthopedic surgery has also changed in recent years. Previously, orthopedic surgeons preferred to perform all of the necessary surgeries a child needed at the same time, usually between the ages of 7 and 10. Because of the length of time spent in recovery, which was generally several months, doing them all at once shortened the amount of time a child spent in bed. Now most of the surgical procedures can be done on an outpatient basis or with a short inpatient stay. Children usually return to <i>their</i> normal lifestyle within a week.</p>\n<p>\n	Consequently, doctors think it is better to stagger surgeries and perform them at times appropriate to a child’s age and level of motor development. For example, spasticity in the upper leg muscles (the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_288">adductors</span>), which causes a “scissor pattern” walk, is a major obstacle to normal gait. The optimal age to correct this spasticity with adduction release surgery is 2 to 4 years of age. On the other hand, the best time to perform surgery to lengthen the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_308">hamstrings</span> or <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_287">Achilles tendon</span> is 7 to 8 years of age. If adduction release surgery is delayed so that it can be performed at the same time as hamstring lengthening, the child will have learned to compensate for spasticity in the adductors. By the time the hamstring surgery is performed, the child’s abnormal gait pattern could be so ingrained that it might not be easily corrected.</p>\n<p>\n	With shorter recovery times and new, less invasive surgical techniques, doctors can schedule surgeries at times that take advantage of a child’s age and developmental abilities for the best possible result.</p>\n<p>\n	<span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_99">Selective dorsal rhizotomy</span> (SDR) is a surgical procedure recommended only for cases of severe spasticity when all of the more conservative treatments—physical therapy, oral medications, and intrathecal baclofen—have failed to reduce spasticity or chronic pain. In the procedure, a surgeon locates and selectively severs over-activated nerves at the base of the spinal column.</p>\n<p>\n	Because it reduces the amount of stimulation that reaches muscles via the nerves, SDR is most commonly used to relax muscles and decrease chronic pain in one or both of the lower or upper limbs. It is also sometimes used to correct an overactive bladder. Potential side effects include sensory loss, numbness, or uncomfortable sensations in limb areas once supplied by the severed nerve.</p>\n<p>\n	Even though the use of microsurgery techniques has refined the practice of SDR surgery, there is still controversy about how selective SDR actually is. Some doctors have concerns since it is invasive and irreversible and may only achieve small improvements in function. Although recent research has shown that combining SDR with physical therapy reduces spasticity in some children, particularly those with spastic diplegia, whether or not it improves gait or function has still not been proven. Ongoing research continues to look at this surgery\'s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>\n	Spinal cord stimulation was developed in the 1980s to treat spinal cord injury and other neurological conditions involving motor neurons. An implanted electrode selectively stimulates nerves at the base of the spinal cord to inhibit and decrease nerve activity. The effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of cerebral palsy has yet to be proven in clinical studies. It is considered a treatment alternative only when other conservative or surgical treatments have been unsuccessful at relaxing muscles or relieving pain.</p>\n', 12, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

This increase in life expectancy is often accompanied by a rise in medical and functional problems—some of them beginning at a relatively early age—including the following:</p>\n<h3>\n	Premature Aging</h3>\n<p>\n	The majority of individuals with cerebral palsy will experience some form of premature aging by the time they reach their 40s because of the extra stress and strain the disease puts upon their bodies. The developmental delays that often accompany cerebral palsy keep some organ systems from developing to their full capacity and level of performance. As a consequence, organ systems such as the <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_295">cardiovascular system</span> and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_325">pulmonary system</span> have to work harder and they age prematurely.</p>\n<h3>\n	Functional Issues at Work</h3>\n<p>\n	The day-to-day challenges of the workplace are likely to increase as an employed individual with cerebral palsy reaches middle age. Some individuals will be able to continue working with accommodations such as an adjusted work schedule, assistive equipment, or frequent rest periods. Early retirement may be necessary for others.</p>\n<h3>\n	Depression</h3>\n<p>\n	Mental health issues can also be of concern as individuals with cerebral palsy grow older. The rate of depression is three to four times higher in people with disabilities such as cerebral palsy. It appears to be related not so much to the severity of their disabilities, but to how well they cope with them. The amount of emotional support someone has, how successful they are at coping with disappointment and stress, and whether or not they have an optimistic outlook about the future all have a significant impact on mental health.</p>\n<h3>\n	Post-Impairment Syndrome</h3>\n<p>\n	Most adults with cerebral palsy experience what is called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_80">post-impairment syndrome</span>, a combination of pain, fatigue, and weakness due to muscle abnormalities, bone deformities, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_73">overuse syndromes</span> (sometimes also called repetitive motion injuries), and arthritis. Fatigue is often a challenge, since individuals with cerebral palsy use three to five times the amount of energy that able-bodied people use when they walk and move about.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:96}}</p>\n\n<h3>\n	Osteoarthritis and Degenerative Arthritis</h3>\n<p>\n	Musculoskeletal abnormalities that may not produce discomfort during childhood can cause pain in adulthood. For example, the abnormal relationships between joint surfaces and excessive joint compression can lead to the early development of painful osteoarthritis and degenerative arthritis. Individuals with cerebral palsy also have limited strength and restricted patterns of movement, which puts them at risk for overuse syndromes and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_66">nerve entrapments</span>.</p>\n<h3>\n	Pain</h3>\n<p>\n	Issues related to pain often go unrecognized by health care providers since individuals with cerebral palsy may not be able to describe the extent or location of their pain. Pain can be acute or chronic, and is experienced most commonly in the hips, knees, ankles, and the upper and lower back. Individuals with spastic cerebral palsy have an increased number of painful sites and worse pain than those with other types of cerebral palsy. The best treatment for pain due to musculoskeletal abnormalities is preventive—correcting skeletal and muscle abnormalities early in life to avoid the progressive accumulation of stress and strain that causes pain. Dislocated hips, which are particularly likely to cause pain, can be surgically repaired. If it is managed properly, pain does not have to become a chronic condition.</p>\n<h3>\n	Other Medical Conditions</h3>\n<p>\n	Adults have higher than normal rates of other medical conditions secondary to their cerebral palsy, such as hypertension, incontinence, bladder dysfunction, and swallowing difficulties. Scoliosis is likely to progress after puberty, when bones have matured into their final shape and size. People with cerebral palsy also have a higher incidence of bone fractures, occurring most frequently during physical therapy sessions. A combination of mouth breathing, poor hygiene, and abnormalities in tooth enamel increase the risk of cavities and periodontal disease. Twenty-five percent to 39 percent of adults with cerebral palsy have vision problems; eight to 18 percent have hearing problems.</p>\n<p>\n	Because of their unique medical situations, adults with cerebral palsy benefit from regular visits to their doctor and ongoing evaluation of their physical status. It is important to evaluate physical complaints to make sure they are not the result of underlying conditions. For example, adults with cerebral palsy are likely to experience fatigue, but fatigue can also be due to undiagnosed medical problems that could be treated and reversed.</p>\n<p>\n	Because many individuals with cerebral palsy outlive their primary caregiver, the issue of long-term care and support should be taken into account and planned for.</p>\n', 15, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(94, 'ds-g80_16', '<h2>Cerebral Palsy Research</h2><p>Investigators from many fields of medicine and health are using their expertise to help improve the treatment and diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Much of their work is supported through the NINDS, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), other agencies within the federal government, nonprofit groups such as the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, and other private institutions.</p>\n<p>\n	The ultimate hope for curing cerebral palsy rests with prevention. In order to prevent cerebral palsy, however, scientists have to understand normal fetal brain development so that they can understand what happens when a baby’s brain develops abnormally.</p>\n<p>\n	Between conception and the birth of a baby, one cell divides to form a handful of cells, and then hundreds, millions, and, eventually, billions of cells. Some of these cells specialize to become brain cells, and then specialize even further into particular types of <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_194">neurons</span> that travel to their appropriate place in the brain (a process that scientists call <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_67">neuronal migration</span>). Once they are in the right place, they establish connections with other brain cells. This is how the brain develops and becomes able to communicate with the rest of the body—through overlapping neural circuits made up of billions of interconnected and interdependent neurons.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:97}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Many scientists now think that a significant number of children develop cerebral palsy because of mishaps early in brain development. They are examining how brain cells specialize and form the right connections, and they are looking for ways to prevent the factors that disrupt the normal processes of brain development.</p>\n<p>\n	Genetic defects are sometimes responsible for the brain malformations and abnormalities that cause cerebral palsy. Scientists funded by the NINDS are searching for the genes responsible for these abnormalities by collecting DNA samples from people with cerebral palsy and their families and using genetic screening techniques to discover linkages between individual genes and specific types of abnormality—primarily those associated with abnormal neuronal migration.</p>\n<p>\n	Scientists are scrutinizing events in newborn babies’ brains, such as bleeding, epileptic seizures, and breathing and circulation problems, which can cause the abnormal release of chemicals that trigger the kind of damage that causes cerebral palsy. For example, research has shown that bleeding in the brain unleashes dangerously high amounts of a brain chemical called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_306">glutamate</span>. Although glutamate is necessary in the brain to help neurons communicate, too much glutamate overexcites and kills neurons. Scientists are now looking closely at glutamate to detect how its release harms brain tissue. By learning how brain chemicals that are normally helpful become dangerously toxic, scientists will have opportunities to develop new drugs to block their harmful effects.</p>\n<p>\n	Scientists funded by the NINDS are also investigating whether substances in the brain that protect neurons from damage, called <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_100">neurotrophins</span>, could be used to prevent brain damage as a result of stroke or oxygen deprivation. Understanding how these <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_68">neuroprotective</span> substances act would allow scientists to develop synthetic neurotrophins that could be given immediately after injury to prevent neuron death and damage.</p>\n<p>\n	The relationship between uterine infections during pregnancy and the risk of cerebral palsy continues to be studied by researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There is evidence that uterine infections trigger inflammation and the production of immune system cells called cytokines, which can pass into an unborn baby’s brain and interrupt normal development. By understanding what cytokines do in the fetal brain and the type of damage these immune system cells cause, researchers have the potential to develop medications that could be given to mothers with uterine infections to prevent brain damage in their unborn children.</p>\n', 16, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(95, 'ds-g80_17', '<h2>Cerebral Palsy Research (Cont.)</h2><p>Approximately 10 percent of newborns are born prematurely, and of those babies, more than 10 percent will have brain injuries that will lead to cerebral palsy and other brain-based disabilities. A particular type of damage to the white matter of the brain, called periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), is the predominant form of brain injury in premature infants. NINDS-sponsored researchers studying PVL are looking for new strategies to prevent this kind of damage by developing safe, nontoxic therapies delivered to at-risk mothers to protect their unborn babies.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:98}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	Although congenital cerebral palsy is a condition that is present at birth, a year or two can pass before any disabilities are noticed. Researchers have shown that the earlier rehabilitative treatment begins, the better the outcome for children with cerebral palsy. But an early diagnosis is hampered by the lack of diagnostic techniques to identify brain damage or abnormalities in infants.</p>\n<p>\n	Research funded by the NINDS is using imaging techniques, devices that measure electrical activity in the brain, and neurobehavioral tests to predict those preterm infants who will develop cerebral palsy. If these screening techniques are successful, doctors will be able to identify infants at risk for cerebral palsy before they are born.</p>\n<p>\n	Noninvasive methods to record the brain activity of unborn babies in the womb and to identify those with brain damage or abnormalities would also be a valuable addition to the diagnostic tool kit. Another NINDS-funded study focuses on the development of <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_304">fetal magnetoencephalography</span> (fMEG)—a technology that would allow doctors to look for abnormalities in fetal brain activity.</p>\n<p>\n	Although physical therapy programs are used almost universally to rehabilitate children with cerebral palsy, there are no definitive studies to indicate which techniques work best. For example, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_298">constraint-induced therapy</span> (CIT) is a type of physical therapy that has been used successfully with adult stroke survivors and individuals who have traumatic brain injury and are left with a weak or disabled arm on one side of the body. The therapy involves restraining the stronger arm in a cast and forcing the weaker arm to perform 6 hours of intensive “shaping” activities every day over the course of 3 weeks. The researchers who conducted the clinical trials in adult stroke survivors realized CIT’s potential for strengthening children’s arms weakened by cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>\n	In a randomized, controlled study of children with cerebral palsy funded by the NIH, researchers put one group of children through conventional physical therapy and another group through 21 consecutive days of CIT. Researchers looked for evidence of improvement in the movement and function of the disabled arm, whether the improvement lasted after the end of treatment, and if it was associated with significant gains in other areas, such as trunk control, mobility, communication, and self-help skills.</p>\n<p>\n	Children receiving CIT outperformed the children receiving conventional physical therapy across all measures of success, including how well they could move their arms after therapy and their ability to do new tasks during the study and then at home with their families. Six months later they still had better control of their arm. The results from this study are the first to prove the benefits of a physical therapy. Additional research to determine the optimal length and intensity of CIT will allow doctors to add this therapy to the cerebral palsy treatment toolbox.</p>\n<p>\n	Studies have shown that functional electrical stimulation is an effective way to target and strengthen spastic muscles, but the method of delivering the electrical pulses requires expensive, bulky devices implanted by a surgeon, or skin surface stimulation applied by a trained therapist. NINDS-funded researchers have developed a high-tech method that does away with the bulky apparatus and lead wires by using a hypodermic needle to inject microscopic wireless devices into specific muscles or nerves. The devices are powered by a telemetry wand that can direct the number and strength of their pulses by remote control. The device has been used to activate and strengthen muscles in the hand, shoulder, and ankle in people with cerebral palsy as well as in stroke survivors.</p>\n<h1>\n	Summary</h1>\n<p>\n	This course should have provided you with a better understanding of cerebral palsy, its treatment options, and the latest research to find safer, more effective ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent the disorder.

	(96, 'ds-g61.0_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Guillain-Barré (pronounced ghee-YAN bah-RAY) is a rare disorder in which a person’s own immune system damages their nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks. Most people recover fully from GBS, but some people have permanent nerve damage. In very rare cases, people have died of GBS, usually from difficulty breathing. In the United States, for example, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS each year on average, whether or not they received a vaccination.</p>\r\n<h1>\r\n	Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h1>\r\n<p>Guillain-Barré syndrome is a disorder in which the body\'s immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In many instances the symmetrical weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the patient is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases the disorder is life threatening—potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or heart rate—and is considered a medical emergency. Such an individual is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing and is watched closely for problems such as an abnormal heartbeat, infections, blood clots, and high or low blood pressure. Most individuals, however, recover from even the most severe cases of GBS, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness.</p>\n\r\n{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\r\n\n<h2>\r\n	Incidence and Prevalence</h2>\r\n<p>Guillain-Barré syndrome can affect anybody. It can strike at any age and both sexes are equally prone to the disorder. The syndrome is rare, however, afflicting only about one person in 100,000. Usually GBS occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. Occasionally surgery will trigger the syndrome. In rare instances vaccinations may increase the risk of GBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:52}}</p>\n\r\n<p>After the first clinical manifestations of the disease, the symptoms can progress over the course of hours, days, or weeks. Most people reach the stage of greatest weakness within the first 2 weeks after symptoms appear, and by the third week of the illness 90 percent of all patients are at their weakest.</p>\r\n', 1, 184, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(97, 'ds-g61.0_02', '<h2>Causes of Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h2><p>No one yet knows why GBS—which is not contagious—strikes some people and not others. Nor does anyone know exactly what sets the disease in motion.</p>\r\n<p>What scientists do know is that the body\'s immune system begins to attack the body itself, causing what is known as an autoimmune disease. Usually the cells of the immune system attack only foreign material and invading organisms. In GBS, however, the immune system starts to destroy the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons of many peripheral nerves, or even the axons themselves (axons are long, thin extensions of the nerve cells; they carry nerve signals). The myelin sheath surrounding the axon speeds up the transmission of nerve signals and allows the transmission of signals over long distances.</p>\r\n<p>In diseases in which the peripheral nerves\' myelin sheaths are injured or degraded, the nerves cannot transmit signals efficiently. That is why the muscles begin to lose their ability to respond to the brain\'s commands, commands that must be carried through the nerve network. The brain also receives fewer sensory signals from the rest of the body, resulting in an inability to feel textures, heat, pain, and other sensations. Alternately, the brain may receive inappropriate signals that result in tingling, "crawling-skin," or painful sensations. Because the signals to and from the arms and legs must travel the longest distances they are most vulnerable to interruption. Therefore, muscle weakness and tingling sensations usually first appear in the hands and feet and progress upwards.</p>\r\n<p>It is thought that GBS may be triggered by an infection. The infection that most commonly precedes GBS is caused by a bacterium called Campylobacter jejuni. Other respiratory or intestinal illnesses and other triggers may also precede an episode of GBS. In 1976, vaccination with the swine flu vaccine was associated with getting GBS. Several studies have been done to evaluate if other flu vaccines since 1976 were associated with GBS. Only one of the studies showed an association. That study suggested that one person out of 1 million vaccinated persons may be at risk of GBS associated with the vaccine.</p>\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:53}}</p>\r\n<p>When GBS is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, it is possible that the virus has changed the nature of cells in the nervous system so that the immune system treats them as foreign cells. It is also possible that the virus makes the immune system itself less discriminating about what cells it recognizes as its own, allowing some of the immune cells, such as certain kinds of lymphocytes and macrophages, to attack the myelin. Sensitized T lymphocytes cooperate with B lymphocytes to produce antibodies against components of the myelin sheath and may contribute to destruction of the myelin. In two forms of GBS, axons are attacked by antibodies against the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni, which react with proteins of the peripheral nerves.  Acute motor axonal neuropathy is particularly common in Chinese children.  Scientists are investigating these and other possibilities to find why the immune system goes awry in GBS and other autoimmune diseases. The cause and course of GBS is an active area of neurological investigation, incorporating the cooperative efforts of neurological scientists, immunologists, and virologists.</p>\r\n<p>Pregnant women do not have a higher risk of contracting GBS. However, the effects of pregnancy and the birth process on the disease are still unknown. A pregnant woman with GBS will usually run the normal course of the disease, although she may run a greater risk of premature birth or of being too weak to give birth normally. Scientists appear to agree that the fetus does not show any symptoms, even though the mother suffers from GBS during the pregnancy.</p>\r\n', 2, 247, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(98, 'ds-g61.0_03', '<h2>Symptoms of Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h2><p>The symptoms of GBS vary a great deal from patient to patient, and so each has a unique case history. Pain appears to be a common feature.</p>\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:54}}</p>\r\n<p>The symptoms usually appear after a preceding infection. They increase in intensity over a period of time, varying from a few hours in serious cases, to around 4 weeks in most patients. The symptoms vary, also with regard to the pattern in which they appear. Their distribution is usually symmetrical and double-sided. This means that the symptoms appear on both the left and right side of the body, but they may also appear randomly, especially in the beginning. They may appear for a short while, disappear for some days, and reappear shortly.</p>\r\n<p>Fever is <u>not</u> a symptom of GBS, but may be caused by the preceding infection that has triggered the syndrome. GBS symptoms vary, depending on whether the syndrome has affected the sensory nerve fibers (that transmit signals from a body area, to the brain and spine), or the motor nerve fibers (that transmit signals from the brain and spine to a body area). When both motor and sensory nerves are affected, the patient experiences a mixture of symptoms. Finally, the patient may also experience disruption in the working of the autonomic nervous system.</p>\r\n<h3>Sensory Nerve Fibers May Be Damaged</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensory nerve fibers may be damaged. Sensory nerves tell us about our surroundings, whether we are hurt, if something is smooth or rough, hot or cold, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms generally begin in the patient\'s feet, hands or face, spread to the legs or arms, and increase in intensity as they move towards the center of the body. They generally appear on both left and right sides of the body. However, GBS is unpredictable, and cases have been reported in which this "glove and stocking" pattern is not followed. Instead, motor symptoms or disruptions in the autonomic system may be observed. GBS may also affect an arm or a leg alone, without spreading to the rest of the body.</p>\r\n<p>Gradually muscle pain is experienced in the large muscles, such as the thighs, back and shoulders. Pain in the lower back, buttocks or thighs is common, and is often the earliest symptom. Stiffness and cramping pain, or deep, aching muscle pain is common. The sensory symptoms then make themselves felt, as the sensory nerves are attacked. The patient experiences loss or reduction of the sense of touch, or abnormal sensations such as burning, tingling, pins and needles, “ants under the skin,” vibrations, numbness, etc.</p>\r\n<p>In some patients, the skin develops hyperalgia (exacerbated by bed sheets, socks and tight-fitting shoes); in some cases, pain may limit walking. Patients with symptoms limited to the feet and ankles may observe similar symptoms in the fingertips; as the symptoms extend to the knees, they may also extend to the wrists. Only rarely do these symptoms extend above the knees.</p>\r\n<p>The patient loses the ability to tell the difference between hot and cold, and may feel cold or may sweat for no apparent reason.

Tendon reflexes are reduced or lost. For example, gently tapping the front of the patient\'s knee will not induce a kick. Progressive weakening or paralysis may occur, typically beginning in the feet, hands or face. The paralysis characteristically involves more than one limb, most commonly the legs. The paralysis is progressive and usually ascending, spreading to the rest of the limb, and from there may spread to the legs, arms and the rest of the body. Legs feel heavy, it gets difficult to stand up or climb stairs, to walk or stand. The patient may have difficulty holding and manipulating objects, such as buttons and toothbrushes. Arms feel weak and the patient can no longer lift heavy objects. The weakness may be accompanied by pain and muscle spasms. Constipation is also often a problem, due to the reduced activity of the intestines, change of diet, weakened stomach muscles that resist efforts by the patient to express the intestinal content. About 28% of patients with GBS remain able to walk unaided.</p>\r\n<p>In some cases, the face may be affected when damage occurs to the cranial nerves. These connect the brain to the muscles of the jaw, face and tongue, and also control the muscles that move the patient\'s head, neck and shoulders. As the paralysis progresses, all these areas may be paralyzed. The eyelids or one side of the face may droop, the face loses its ability to express feelings. The patient\'s voice may change because the vocal chords are affected. Speech may be unintelligible, because the various muscles required to form speech are weakened. Deafness is unusual but has been reported.</p>\r\n<h3>Autonomic Nervous System May Be Disrupted</h3>\r\n<p>The combination of pain, weakness and sensory disruptions are generally so alarming that the more discreet changes in the patient\'s autonomic nervous system may be overlooked. These may be just as serious, as detailed below.</p>\r\n<p>The autonomic nervous system controls the inner organs, whose function is normally carried out automatically, such as secretion of hormones, vision, urination, breathing, heart beat, etc. These functions may be disrupted, resulting in arrhythmia, unstable blood pressure, blurred or double vision, dizziness, fainting spells, inability to regulate the body temperature, difficulty breathing, reduced ability to control the function of the stomach, digestive system and bladder, loss of weight, vomiting after meals, reduced function of various glands, incontinence, impotency, etc. It may be difficult to urinate and the bladder may feel as it is not being emptied.</p>', 4, 200, 1, NULL, NULL),

They circulate in the blood seeking myelin, which is found in nerve cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nerve cells have long, thin extensions called axons that transmit signals between nerve cells. Some axons are surrounded by a myelin sheath, a little like electrical cables are surrounded by plastic. The myelin sheath insulates and protects the nerve cells. It also increases both the speed and the distance over which nerve signals can be transmitted.</p>\r\n<p>Myelin does not cover the axon in an uninterrupted tube, like an electrical cable. Instead, it resembles long beads on a string, with space between the beads. The spaces are known as nodes of Ranvier. Axons are uncovered between these nodes of Ranvier and are therefore vulnerable to attack.</p>\r\n<p>The nerve signals transmitted are also delayed at the nodes, and the more nodes there are, the slower the signal becomes. This fact is important when understanding recovery—increased numbers of Ranvier nodes may be produced during nerve recovery, slowing signal transmission.</p>\r\n<p>The myelin-attacking antibodies produced in the GBS individual circulate in the blood and eventually find myelin. They attack and destroy it with the help of white blood cells, producing inflammation in the nerves. The inflamed cells in turn secrete chemicals that affect the Schwann cells. These cells produce the fatty materials required to produce myelin. Affecting Schwann cells reduces myelin production, and some of them may even die, further reducing myelin production, while at the same time the existing myelin is destroyed by the antibodies.</p>\r\n', 7, 230, 1, NULL, NULL),

A syndrome is a medical condition characterized by a collection of symptoms (what the patient feels) and signs (what a doctor can observe or measure). The signs and symptoms of the syndrome can be quite varied, so doctors may, on rare occasions, find it difficult to diagnose GBS in its earliest stages.</p>\r\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:57}}</p>\r\n<p>Several disorders have symptoms similar to those found in Guillain-Barré, so doctors examine and question patients carefully before making a diagnosis. Collectively, the signs and symptoms form a certain pattern that helps doctors differentiate Guillain-Barré from other disorders. For example, physicians will note whether the symptoms appear on both sides of the body (most common in Guillain-Barré) and the quickness with which the symptoms appear (in other disorders, muscle weakness may progress over months rather than days or weeks). In Guillain-Barré, reflexes such as knee jerks are usually lost. Because the signals traveling along the nerve are slower, a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test can give doctor clues to aid the diagnosis. In Guillain-Barré patients, the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain contains more protein than usual. Therefore a physician may decide to perform a spinal tap, a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the patient\'s lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal column is withdrawn for study.</p>\r\n<p>In order to facilitate the ruling-out process, the patient is asked if he or she has been in contact with poisons (pesticides, chemicals, toxins, etc.), about his or her alcohol consumption, recent infections, other diseases (diabetes, family history of nerve disease, etc.), tick bites, etc. The physician also asks about the course of the disease so far, and can often diagnose the disease on the basis of all these factors. In some cases, further examinations may be required to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\r\n<p>These examinations may include one or more of the following laboratory tests and electrodiagnostic studies: Blood and urine tests, x-rays, scans, lumbar puncture, nerve conduction velocity test (NCV), electromyogram (EMG). An electrocardiogram (ECG) may be undertaken to confirm or rule out irregular heartbeat. A stool test may be done to check for the presence of stomach infections that triggered the attack.</p>\r\n<p>These tests can, in some cases, indicate whether the disease is of the demyelinating or the axonal type, indicating what the course of the disease is likely to be.</p>\r\n', 9, 176, 1, NULL, NULL),

Although sexual harassment is not new, nor are the legal remedies against it, understanding what constitutes sexual harassment in the workplace is critical for both employees and employers because it has become so common in the workplace that people often fail to recognize offensive behavior as wrong. This may be partially explained by our society that has become desensitized to offensive behaviors, but more likely a result of a lack of sexual harassment education and training in the workplace and the associated consequences as defined by law. Sexual harassment in any form is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.

Violations often include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Unwanted or unwelcomed sexual advances</li>\n	<li>\n		Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances</li>\n	<li>\n		Visual conduct, e.g., leering, making sexual gestures, displaying of suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters</li>\n	<li>\n		Verbal conduct, e.g., making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, and jokes</li>\n	<li>\n		Verbal sexual advances or propositions</li>\n	<li>\n		Verbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentaries about an individual\'s body, sexually degrading words used to describe an individual, suggestive or obscene letters, notes or invitations</li>\n	<li>\n		Physical conduct, e.g., touching, assault, impeding or blocking movements</li>\n	<li>\n		Conduct that explicitly or implicitly affects an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Although the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines specifically address conduct that is sexual in nature, the EEOC notes that sex-based harassment that is, harassment <u>not</u> involving sexual activity or language, may also give rise to Title VII liability (just as in the case of harassment based on race, national origin or religion) if it is "sufficiently patterned or pervasive" and directed at employees because of their sex.</p>\n<p>\n	Acts of physical aggression, intimidation, hostility, or unequal treatment based on sex may be combined with incidents of sexual harassment to establish the existence of discriminatory terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p>\n	Sexual harassment remains a problem in all workplaces.

Although the federal employment discrimination statutes do <u>not</u> contain or define the term "supervisor," the statutes make employers liable for the discriminatory acts of their "agents," and supervisors are agents of their employers. An individual qualifies as an employee\'s "supervisor" or “agent” if the individual has authority to undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions or actions affecting the employee or the individual has authority to direct the employee\'s daily work activities.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:217}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	However, agency principles <i>may not be transferable in all their particulars</i> to the federal employment discrimination statutes. The determination of whether an individual has sufficient authority to qualify as a "supervisor" for purposes of vicarious liability cannot be resolved by a purely mechanical application of agency law. Rather, the purposes of the anti-discrimination statutes and the reasoning of the Supreme Court decisions on harassment must be considered.</p>\n<p>\n	The Supreme Court, in <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_278"><i>Faragher</i></span> and <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_277"><i>Ellerth</i></span>, reasoned that vicarious liability for supervisor harassment is appropriate because supervisors are aided in such misconduct by the authority that the employers delegated to them. Therefore, that authority must be of a sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_277">explicitly</span> or <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_279">implicitly</span> in carrying out the harassment. The determination as to whether a harasser had such authority is based on his or her job function rather than job title (e.g., "team leader") and must be based on the specific facts.</p>\n<h2>\n	Harasser Outside Supervisory Chain of Command</h2>\n<p>\n	In some circumstances, an organization may be subject to vicarious liability for harassment by a supervisor who does not have actual authority over the employee. Such a result is appropriate if the employee reasonably believed that the harasser had such power. The employee might have such a belief because, for example, the chain of command is unclear. Alternatively, the employee might reasonably believe that a harasser with broad delegated powers has the ability to significantly influence employment decisions affecting him or her even if the harasser is outside the employee\'s chain of command.</p>\n<p>\n	If the harasser had no actual supervisory power over the employee, and the employee did not reasonably believe that the harasser had such authority, then the standard of liability for co-worker harassment applies.</p>\n<h2>\n	Co-Worker Sexual Harassment</h2>\n<p>\n	With respect to conduct between fellow employees, an employer is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took <i>immediate and appropriate</i> corrective action.</p>\n<h2>\n	Non-Employee Sexual Harassment</h2>\n<p>\n	An employer may also be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees in the workplace, where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.

	(116, 'oc0300.1_04', '<h2>Same-Sex Sexual Harassment</h2><p>	Sexual harassment can occur between individuals of the same gender. The same standards that apply to sexual harassment between individuals of the opposite sex apply to harassment cases involving individuals of the same gender. Under a same-sex sexual harassment claim, the sexual orientations of the parties are irrelevant, as the harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to be actionable. In addition, there is no requirement that a complainant prove the conduct was motivated by his or her gender.</p>\n<h2>\n	Sexual Harassment Outside of the Workplace</h2>\n<p>\n	Sexual harassment between co-workers that takes place outside the workplace may be applicable dependent on the assessment of the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Whether the event at which the conduct occurred is linked to the workplace in any way, such as at an employer-sponsored function</li>\n	<li>\n		Whether the conduct occurred during work hours</li>\n	<li>\n		The severity of the alleged outside-of-work conduct</li>\n	<li>\n		The work relationship of the complainant and alleged harasser, which includes whether the alleged harasser is a supervisor and whether the alleged harasser and complainant come into contact with one another on the job</li>\n	<li>\n		Whether the conduct adversely affected the terms and conditions of the complainant\'s employment or impacted the complainant\'s work environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Title VII does not exclude all conduct of a sexual nature in the workplace. Thus it is crucial to clearly define sexual harassment: only <i>unwelcome</i> sexual conduct that is a term or condition of employment constitutes a violation. The EEOC\'s guidelines define two types of sexual harassment: <i>quid pro quo and hostile environment.</i> However, it should be noted that harassing conduct does not necessarily need to be motivated by sexual desire in order to constitute sexual harassment.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:216}}</p>\n\n<h2>\n	Non-Physical Harassment</h2>\n<p>\n	When the alleged harassment consists of verbal conduct, the investigation should ascertain the nature, frequency, context, and intended target of the remarks. Questions to be explored might include:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Did the alleged harasser single out the charging party?</li>\n	<li>\n		Did the charging party participate?</li>\n	<li>\n		What was the relationship between the charging party and the alleged harasser(s)?</li>\n	<li>\n		Were the remarks hostile and derogatory?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	No one factor alone determines whether particular conduct violates Title VII. EEOC guidelines emphasize that it is the totality of the circumstances used to evaluate a claim of sexual harassment. In general, a woman does not forfeit her right to be free from sexual harassment by choosing to work in an atmosphere that has traditionally included vulgar, anti-female language and vice versa.</p>\n<p>\n	The EEOC believes these factors rarely will be relevant and agrees that a woman does not assume the risk of harassment by voluntarily entering an abusive, anti-female environment. <i>Title VII\'s precise purpose is to prevent such behavior and attitudes from poisoning the work environment of classes protected under the Act.</i></p>\n', 4, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

When considering any past conduct of the charging party that is offered to show <i>welcomeness</i> it must relate to the alleged harasser. District courts have rendered decisions that strongly conclude that the victim’s own past conduct and use of foul language showed that <i>she was the kind of person who could not be offended by such comments and therefore welcomed them generally, even though she had told the harasser to leave her alone.</i> However, the court of appeals held that the victim’s use of foul language or sexual innuendo in a consensual setting does not waive <i>her legal protections against unwelcome harassment.</i> Thus, evidence concerning the charging party’s general character and past behavior toward others has limited, if any, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_283">probative</span> value and does not substitute for a careful examination of her behavior toward the alleged harasser.</p>\n<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">\n	<tbody>\n		<tr>\n			<td>{{COURSE_IMAGE:218}}</td>\n			<td>{{COURSE_IMAGE:219}}</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr align="center">\n			<td>\n				Welcome</td>\n			<td>\n				Unwelcome</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n	A more difficult situation occurs when an employee first willingly participates in conduct of a sexual nature but then ceases to participate and claims that any continued sexual conduct has created a hostile work environment. Here the employee has the burden of showing that any further sexual conduct is unwelcome, work-related harassment. The employee must clearly notify the alleged harasser that his conduct is no longer welcome. If the conduct still continues, her failure to bring the matter to the attention of higher management or the EEOC is evidence, though not <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_275">dispositive</span>, that any continued conduct is, in fact, welcome or unrelated to work.

	(118, 'oc0300.1_06', '<h2>Quid Pro Quo</h2><p>The Latin term, <i>quid pro quo</i> is widely used to denote a type of sexual harassment in two variations, one of which is comparable to <i>bribery</i> and the other to <i>blackmail.</i> In other words, <i>quid pro quo</i> essentially means <i>do something in exchange for something.</i> The harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature in exchange for receiving a tangible benefit or simple continuation of a current benefit. In this type of harassment the employee is forced to choose between submitting to sexual advances or losing a tangible benefit. Examples of such impact may include but are not limited to: termination; demotion; denial of promotion; transfer; alteration of duties, hours or compensation; or unjustified performance reviews.</p>\n<p>\n	An essential aspect of quid pro quo harassment is the harasser\'s power to control the employee\'s employment benefits.

They can be implied by circumstances and actions: for example, inviting an employee or an employer out for drinks, offering sexually explicit magazines, or sending sexually explicit e-mails are all forms of quid pro quo harassment. Quid pro quo harassment claims usually involve the accuser establishing that the alleged harasser made sexual advances or requests, or otherwise engaged in conduct of a sexual nature; the sexual conduct was unwelcome; such advances or advances, requests, or conduct was rejected; and the terms or conditions of his or her employment were then adversely affected or if the accuser submitted to the unwelcome sexual conduct, he or she did so in reasonable fear of adverse employment action.</p>\n<p>\n	Although <i>quid pro quo</i> and <i>hostile work environment</i> harassment are theoretically distinct claims, the line between the two is <u>not</u> always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together.

Hostile behavior or conduct is very specific, especially in a legal setting when bringing charges against an employer for either wrongful termination or for creating an environment that causes severe stress to the employee. Whether conduct interferes with an individual\'s ability to perform his or her job is essentially a question of fact based on the totality of the circumstances, which includes the nature, severity, and pervasiveness of the conduct and the psychological harm to the employee. Conduct that interferes with an employee\'s ability to do his or her job need not necessarily cause severe psychological harm or emotional distress to be actionable.</p>\n<p>\n	In determining whether unwelcome sexual conduct rises to the level of a <i>hostile environment</i> in violation of Title VII, the central inquiry is whether the conduct <i>unreasonably interferes with an individual\'s work performance</i> or creates an <i>intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</i> Thus, sexual flirtation or innuendo, even vulgar language that is trivial or merely annoying behavior, would probably <u>not</u> constitute sexual conduct that would be considered a hostile environment.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:221}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	In determining whether harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment, the harasser\'s conduct should be evaluated from the objective standpoint of a <i>reasonable person.</i> The intended use of Title VII does not serve <i>as a vehicle for vindicating the petty slights suffered by the hypersensitive.</i> Thus, if the challenged conduct would not substantially affect the work environment of a <i>reasonable person,</i> no violation should be found. For example, a coworker alleges that another coworker made repeated advances toward him/her and the investigation reveals that the alleged <i>advances</i> consisted of invitations to join a group of employees who regularly socialized at dinner after work. The coworker’s invitations viewed in this particular context and from the perspective of a <i>reasonable person,</i> would not constitute a hostile work environment and therefore would not constitute sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>\n	Examples of behavior or conduct that might create a hostile work environment include but are not limited to the following: inappropriate touching; sexual epithets, jokes, gossip, sexual conduct or comments; requests for sex; displaying sexually suggestive pictures and objects; and leering, whistling, or sexual gestures. In addition, if an employer attempts to create a situation to make an employee quit his or her job voluntarily; this too is considered a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p>\n	Lastly, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_281">overt</span> hostility that threatens an employee physically is considered to be a hostile work environment.

For example, the EEOC believes that a workplace in which sexual slurs, displays of "girlie" pictures, and other offensive conduct abound can constitute a hostile work environment even if many people deem it to be harmless or insignificant. This objective standard should <u>not</u> be applied in a vacuum, however. Consideration should be given to the context in which the alleged harassment took place.

As the Supreme Court stated, <i>tangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor.</i></p>\n<p>\n	An individual whose job responsibilities include the authority to recommend tangible job decisions affecting an employee qualifies as his or her supervisor even if the individual does not have the final say. As the Supreme Court recognized in <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_274"><i>Ellerth</i></span>, a tangible employment decision <i>may be subject to review by higher-level supervisors.</i> As long as the individual\'s recommendation is given substantial weight by the final decision maker(s), that individual meets the definition of supervisor. Any employment action qualifies as "tangible" if it results in a significant change in employment status.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue”>\n                <p>For example, significantly changing an individual\'s duties in his or her existing job constitutes a tangible employment action regardless of whether the individual retains the same salary and benefits. Similarly, altering an individual\'s duties in a way that blocks his or her opportunity for promotion or salary increases also constitutes a tangible employment action.<br />\n	<br />\n	On the other hand, an employment action does not reach the threshold of "tangible" if it results in only an insignificant change in the complainant\'s employment status. For example, altering an individual\'s job title does not qualify as a tangible employment action if there is no change in salary, benefits, duties, or prestige, and the only effect is a bruised ego. However, if there were a significant change in the status of the position because the new title is less prestigious and thereby effectively constitutes a demotion, a tangible employment action would be found.</p></div>\n\n<p>\n	If a supervisor undertakes or recommends a tangible job action based on a subordinate\'s response to unwelcome sexual demands, <i>the employer is liable</i> and <i>cannot</i> raise the <i>affirmative defense,</i> which will be discussed in further detail in the next section. The result is the same whether the employee rejects the demands and is subjected to an adverse tangible employment action or submits to the demands and consequently obtains a tangible job benefit.</p>\n<p>\n	Such harassment previously would have been characterized as <i>quid pro quo.</i> It would be a perverse result if the employer is foreclosed from raising the affirmative defense if its supervisor denies a tangible job benefit based on an employee\'s rejection of unwelcome sexual demands, but can raise the defense if its supervisor grants a tangible job benefit based on submission to such demands. The EEOC rejects such an analysis. In both those situations the supervisor undertakes a tangible employment action on a discriminatory basis. The Supreme Court stated that there must be a significant change in employment status—it did not require that the change be adverse in order to qualify as tangible.</p>\n<p>\n	If a challenged employment action is not <i>tangible,</i> it may still be considered, along with other evidence, as part of a hostile environment claim that is subject to the affirmative defense. In <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_274"><i>Ellerth</i></span>, the Court concluded that there was no tangible employment action because the supervisor never carried out his threats of job harm. <i>Ellerth</i> could still proceed with her claim of harassment, but the claim was properly categorized as a hostile work environment claim which requires a showing of severe or pervasive conduct.</p>\n', 8, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

	(123, 'oc0300.1_11', '<h1>Standard of Liability</h1><p>When harassment by a supervisor creates an unlawful hostile environment but does <u>not</u> result in a tangible employment action, the employer <i>can</i> raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, which it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. The defense consists of two necessary elements:</p>\n<ol>\n	<li>\n		The employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassment, and</li>\n	<li>\n		The employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	If an employer can prove that it discharged its duty of reasonable care and that the employee could have avoided all of the harm but unreasonably failed to do so, the employer will avoid all liability for unlawful harassment.</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue”>\n                <p>For example, if an employee was subjected to a pattern of sexual harassment that created an unlawful hostile environment, but the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management before he/she suffered emotional harm and the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct the harassment, then the employer will avoid all liability.</p></div>\n<p>\n	If an employer cannot prove that it discharged its duty of reasonable care and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid the harm, the employer will be liable.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue”>\n                <p>For example, if unlawful harassment by a supervisor occurred and the employer failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent it, the employer will be liable even if the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management or even if the employer took prompt and appropriate corrective action when it gained notice.</p></div>\n	<p>\n	In most circumstances, if employers and employees discharge their respective duties of reasonable care, unlawful harassment will be prevented and there will be no reason to consider questions of liability. An effective complaint procedure encourages employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive, and if an employee promptly utilizes that procedure, the employer can usually stop the harassment before actionable harm occurs.</p>\n<p>\n	In some circumstances, however, unlawful harassment will occur and harm will result despite the exercise of requisite legal care by the employer and employee.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue”>\n                <p>For example, if an employee\'s supervisor directed frequent, <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_276">egregious</span> sexual remarks towards a subordinate, that caused emotional harm virtually from the outset, and the employee promptly complained, corrective action by the employer could prevent further harm but might not correct the actionable harm that the employee already had suffered.<br />\n	<br />\n	Alternatively, if an employee complained about harassment before it became severe or pervasive, remedial measures undertaken by the employer might fail to stop the harassment before it reaches an actionable level, even if those measures are reasonably calculated to halt it.</p></div>\n<p>\n	In these circumstances, the employer will be liable because the defense requires proof that it exercised reasonable legal care and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid the harm. While a notice-based negligence standard would absolve the employer of liability, the standard set forth in <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher</i> does not. As the Court explained, vicarious liability sets a <i>more stringent standard</i> for the employer than the <i>minimum standard</i> of negligence theory.</p>\n<p>\n	While this result may seem harsh to a law-abiding employer, it is consistent with liability standards under the anti-discrimination statutes that generally make employers responsible for the discriminatory acts of their supervisors.</p>\n<p>\n	Harassment is the only type of discrimination carried out by a supervisor for which an employer can avoid liability, and that limitation must be construed narrowly. The employer will be shielded from liability for harassment by a supervisor only if it proves that it exercised reasonable care in preventing and correcting the harassment and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid all of the harm. If both parties exercise reasonable care, the defense will fail.</p>\n<p>\n	In some cases, an employer will be unable to avoid liability completely, but may be able to establish the affirmative defense as a means to limit damages. The defense only limits damages where the employee reasonably could have avoided some but not all of the harm from the harassment. In the example noted above, in which the supervisor used frequent, egregious sexual remarks, an unreasonable delay by the employee in complaining could limit damages but not eliminate liability entirely. This is because a reasonably prompt complaint would have reduced, but not eliminated, the actionable harm.</p>\n<p>\n	Overall, the question of liability arises only after there is a determination that unlawful harassment occurred. Harassment does not violate federal law unless it involves discriminatory treatment on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age of 40 or older, disability, or protected activity under the anti-discrimination statutes. Furthermore, the anti-discrimination statutes are not a <i>general civility</i> code.</p>\n<p>\n	The federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not <i>extremely serious.</i> Rather, the conduct must be <i>so objectively offensive as to alter the \'conditions\' of the victim\'s employment.</i> The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminated in a tangible employment action or was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.</p>\n', 11, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(124, 'oc0300.1_12', '<h2>Employer’s Duty to Exercise Reasonable Care</h2><p>	The first stage of the affirmative defense requires a showing by the employer that it undertook reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassment. Such reasonable care generally requires an employer to establish, disseminate, and enforce an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure and to take other reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment. The steps described below are <u>not</u> mandatory requirements; whether or not an employer can prove that it exercised reasonable care depends on the particular factual circumstances and, in some cases, the nature of the employer\'s workforce.

As the Supreme Court stated, <i>Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of anti-harassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms.</i> While the Court noted that this <i>is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law,</i> failure to do so will make it difficult for an employer to prove that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment.

If some but not all of the harm could have been avoided, then an award of damages will be mitigated accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n	A complaint by an employee does not automatically defeat the employer\'s affirmative defense. If, for example, the employee provided no information to support his or her allegation, gave untruthful information, or otherwise failed to cooperate in the investigation, the complaint would not qualify as an effort to avoid harm. Furthermore, if the employee unreasonably delayed complaining, and an earlier complaint could have reduced the harm, then the affirmative defense could operate to reduce damages.

	(126, 'oc0300.1_14', '<h3>Preventive Action</h3><p>Obviously the ability to prevent sexual harassment of any sort in the workplace should be the employer’s main objective. In fact, the EEOC’s guidelines encourage employers to take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as affirmatively raising the subject, expressing strong disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment under Title VII, and developing methods to sensitize all concerned.</p>\n<p>\n	An effective preventive program should include an explicit policy against sexual harassment that is clearly and regularly communicated to employees and effectively implemented. The employer should affirmatively raise the subject with all supervisory and non-supervisory employees, express strong disapproval, and explain the sanctions for harassment. The employer should also have a procedure for resolving sexual harassment complaints. The procedure should be designed to <i>encourage victims of harassment to come forward</i> and should <u>not</u> require a victim to complain first to the offending supervisor <i>(see Vinson, 106 S. Ct. at 2408).</i> It should ensure confidentiality as much as possible and provide effective remedies, including protection of victims and witnesses against retaliation.</p>\n<h3>\n	Investigating and Evaluating</h3>\n<p>\n	The best defense against sexual harassment is prevention; this ideal is simply an unrealistic expectation, which concludes that employer’s must establish appropriate training, policies, and procedures that are enforced to protect both employees and employers. The EEOC recognizes that sexual conduct may be private and unacknowledged, with no eyewitnesses. Even sexual conduct that occurs openly in the workplace may appear to be consensual. Thus the resolution of a sexual harassment claim often depends on the credibility of the parties.</p>\n<p>\n	The EEOC is comprised of impartial investigators allowing each case to be determined on a case-by-case basis without rendering favoritism to any parties involved. Throughout investigations and evaluations the EEOC investigator should question the charging party and the alleged harasser in detail to aide in a thorough search for corroborative evidence of any nature.</p>\n<p>\n	In certain instances investigators may question other employees to ascertain if they noticed changes in either party’s behavior or treatment at work. In addition, the EEOC investigator should also question supervisors and managerial employees, as well as co-workers, about their knowledge or involvement of the alleged harassment.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:226}}</p>\n\n<p>\n	In appropriate cases, the EEOC may make a finding of harassment based solely on the credibility of the victim\'s allegation.

By the same token, a general denial by the alleged harasser will carry little weight when other evidence contradicts it.</p>\n<p>\n	Of course, the EEOC recognizes that a charging party may not be able to identify witnesses to the alleged conduct itself. But testimony may be obtained from persons who observed the charging party\'s demeanor immediately after an alleged incident of harassment. It would be appropriate to interview persons with whom he or she discussed the incident with, which may include co-workers, a doctor, or a counselor for example.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue”>\n                <p>An employee alleges that her supervisor made unwelcome sexual advances toward her on frequent occasions while they were alone in his office. The supervisor denies this allegation. No one witnessed the alleged advances. The employee\'s inability to produce eyewitnesses to the harassment does not defeat her claim. The resolution will depend on the credibility of her allegations versus that of her supervisor\'s. Corroborating, credible evidence will establish her claim. For example, three co-workers state that the employee looked distraught on several occasions after leaving the supervisor\'s office, and that she informed them on those occasions that he had sexually propositioned and touched her. In addition, the evidence shows that the employee had complained to the general manager of the office about the incidents soon after they occurred. The corroborating witness testimony and her complaint to higher management would be sufficient to establish her claim. Her allegations would be further strengthened if other employees testified that the supervisor propositioned them as well.<br />\n	<br />\n	If the investigation exhausts all possibilities for obtaining corroborative evidence, but finds none, the EEOC may make a cause finding based solely on a reasoned decision to credit the charging party\'s testimony.</p></div>\n	\n<p>\n	In a <i>quid pro quo</i> case, a finding that the employer\'s asserted reasons for its adverse action against the charging party are <span class="glossary-word" id="glossary_word_282">pretextual</span> will usually establish a violation. The investigation should determine the validity of the employer\'s reasons for the charging party\'s termination. If they are pretextual and if the sexual harassment occurred, then it should be inferred that the charging party was terminated for rejecting the employer\'s sexual advances, as she claims.

A preliminary total of 4,405 fatal work injuries were reported in the United States in 2013, according to the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) program conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The rate of fatal work injury for U.S. workers in 2013 was 3.2 per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. Transportation incidents accounted for 40% of the fatal work injuries in 2013. Of the 1,740 fatal transportation-related incidents, 57% (992 cases) were roadway incidents. Most of the occupational fatalities (62%) occur between the hours of 7 a.m. and 4 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 2003-2009, on average:</p>\r\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1,308 workers died each year from crashes on public highways.</li>\r\n	<li>316 workers died each year in crashes that occurred off the highway or on industrial premises.</li>\r\n	<li>347 pedestrian workers died each year as a result of being struck by a motor vehicle.</li>\r\n</ul></div>\r\n<p>Risk of work-related motor vehicle crashes cuts across all industries and occupations. Workers who drive on the job may be “professional” drivers whose primary job is to transport freight or passengers.  Many other workers spend a substantial part of the workday driving a vehicle owned or leased by their employer, or a personal vehicle.  In the United States, companies and drivers that operate large trucks and buses are covered by comprehensive safety regulations. In contrast, there are no Federal occupational safety regulations that cover the workers who use smaller employer-provided vehicles or personal vehicles.</p>', 1, 246, 1, NULL, NULL),

While compassion fatigue has not been labeled a psychiatric disorder, it can lead to depression and anxiety disorders, according to Dr. Caroline Carney Doebbeling, a member of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center (where she is an internist and a psychiatrist as well as a health services researcher). Dr. Doebbeling states:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n                <p>We are taught in medicine to be brave and to be strong, but there should also be a time and place for emotional expression, and perhaps even for crying. Doctors, nurses, and other members of the healthcare team must be steady sources of support for patients. But when the patient encounter is over, at the end of the day, the doctor or nurse or social worker or clerk needs to be able to process everything they have seen and experienced. We need to support people who work with the sickest of the sick.</p></div>\n\n<p>The healthcare industry is becoming more aware of the profound emotional disturbances that occur in healthcare providers when they witness the suffering and pain of their patients in the face of an incurable disease. Healthcare providers are often partners in this journey, and although the understanding of the effects of caring for the terminally ill on the caregiver is limited, studies confirm that care providers play host to a high level of compassion fatigue. The purpose of this course is to identify the prevalence of compassion fatigue among care providers, how to detect it, and means of prevention and treatment.</p>\n<p>\n	This course is part of a monthly safety inservice series provided to employees as a way to help control risks associated with the performance of activities that have the potential for causing harm to employees. This course applies to all care providers. It applies to persons working on behalf of {{LOCATION:NAME}} whose job performance requires the care of patients, face-to-face patient care interaction, and to any other personnel that may provide support to his/her fellow employees.</p>\n\n{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\n\n<h1>\n	Compassion Fatigue</h1>\n<p>\n	Dr. Charles Figley, world-renowned trauma expert and pioneer researcher in the field of helper burnout, has called compassion fatigue a <i>disorder that affects those who do their work well</i>.</p>\n<p>\n	The term compassion fatigue was first coined in the 1990s to describe a syndrome experienced by a healthcare provider caring for individuals facing dire consequences because of their disease. Compassion fatigue goes beyond empathy or <i>feeling bad</i> for a patient and perhaps their family. Compassion fatigue effects nurses, doctors, and other members of the healthcare team, including family members that care for relatives, in a way that often causes the care provider to develop a distance from patients as a way of self-protection.</p>\n\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:356}}</p>\n\n\n<p>\n	On a daily basis, care providers struggle to function in caregiving environments that constantly present heart wrenching, emotional challenges. Affecting positive change in society, a mission so vital to those passionate about caring for others, is perceived as elusive, if not impossible. This painful reality, coupled with first-hand knowledge of society\'s flagrant disregard for the safety and well-being of the feeble and frail, takes its toll on everyone from full-time employees to part-time volunteers.</p>\n<p>\n	Eventually, negative attitudes prevail in nurses, doctors, and other frontline care providers that significantly impacts how they interact with patients, patient families, other healthcare workers, and with their own family, according to analysis by Indiana University School of Medicine. Caroline Carney Doebbeling, M.D, principal investigator, and associate professor of medicine and of psychiatry at the IU School of Medicine states:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n                <p>Individuals who are drawn into healthcare careers may be more likely to develop compassion fatigue, based on their drive for perfection and to do their best for their patients. If you work in an environment where despite your very best efforts patients for whom you provide care will not survive, there is a set up for developing a sense of “there is nothing I can do anymore.”</p></div>\n<p>\n	It has been shown that, when we are suffering from compassion fatigue, we work <i>more</i> rather than <i>less</i>. What suffers is our health, our relationships with others, our personal lives, our employer, and eventually the care we provide to our patients.</p>\n<p>\n	Accepting the presence of compassion fatigue only serves to validate the fact that we are deeply caring individuals. It is possible to practice healthy, ongoing self-care while successfully continuing to care for others by being able to recognize the causes and symptoms of compassion fatigue, employing healing practices, and simple prevention practices.</p>', 1, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(137, 'ms0117_02', '<h2>Recognizing Compassion Fatigue</h2><p>Compassion fatigue does not occur solely in care providers and crisis workers. Giving informal support to an individual can have the same effect on a friend as on a professional therapist. Be aware that giving emotional support, while often beneficial and rewarding, can be draining and may set the stage for compassion fatigue.</p>\n<p>\n	Compassion fatigue is a normal display of chronic stress resulting from the caregiving work we choose to do. Leading traumatologist Eric Gentry suggests that people who are attracted to caregiving often enter the field already compassion fatigued. A strong identification with helpless, suffering, or traumatized people is possibly the motive. It is common to hail from a tradition of what Gentry labels: other-directed caregiving. Simply put, we are people who were taught at an early age to care for the needs of others before caring for our own needs causing absenteeism of authentic, ongoing self-care practices.</p>\n<h3>\n	Individual Signs and Symptoms</h3>\n<p>\n	Symptoms of compassion fatigue include chronic tiredness and irritability, lack of joy in life, engagement in behaviors that are typically acceptable in moderation, such as drinking, at a destructive level. Much like individuals who have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), care providers experiencing compassion fatigue often re-experience the deaths of their patients.</p>\n<p>\n	While the symptoms are often disruptive, depressive, and irritating, having an <i>awareness</i> of the causes, symptoms, and their negative effect on our own lives and the lives of the people we care for, life can lead to positive change, personal transformation, and a new resiliency. By definition, compassion fatigue is a type of burnout. Whether you are a paid professional, a volunteer—or both—the signs and symptoms are similar.

We are tasked with protecting patients’ rights, caring for the terminally ill, and interacting with relatives, friends, and other care providers in hopes of delivering superior patient care while being confronted on a daily basis with intricate moral and ethical issues.</p>\n<p>\n	The University of Pennsylvania conducted a study confirming that the ethical and moral issues healthcare professionals are challenged with causes stress, affects job satisfaction, and overall employee retention rates. The study, which surveyed 1,215 practicing nurses and social workers in fours states and differing census regions, revealed 25 percent of those surveyed want to leave their healthcare profession, 41 percent declined to say they would choose their profession again if given an opportunity to start over.</p>\n<p>\n	Connie Ulrich, Ph.D., RN, assistant professor of Bioethics and Nursing for the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, stated that the healthcare community is aware of the problems concerning ethical and moral distress, but there has not been much research or evidence concerning the effects of these issues and how the stress impacts a healthcare professional’s life. Dr. Ulrich goes on to say:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue"><p>We knew that providers were facing tremendous amounts of stress in providing care to patients but we really didn’t have empirical evidence to help us better understand the problems. We surveyed nurses and social workers in the U.S. and found that both groups of providers feel a sense of powerlessness within the system, both are tired, both feel overwhelmed and both feel frustrated.</p></div>\n\n<p>\n	The nurses and social workers that were surveyed worked in a variety of settings and it was concluded that 40 percent of the healthcare professionals surveyed are frustrated and 40 percent are fatigued. More than startling is the fact that one out of three feels powerless and they even said they were physically ill.</p>\n<p>\n	According to Ulrich, two out of three respondents also reported that there were ethical issues that they felt they couldn’t do anything about and 39 percent cited that there were no organizational resources to assist them with ethical problems.</p>\n<p>\n	The healthcare industry is lacking the awareness needed to combat moral and ethical distress. With only limited ethics and moral training and resources available, feelings of distress amongst the majority of our industries care providers is going unnoticed and untreated, which in turn negatively influences our confidence to act as moral agents and lessens the likeliness that we will actually seek the support we need.</p>\n<p>\n	According to the study, the most common situations that create ethical and moral distress in healthcare professionals in the workplace include: issues concerning patient rights and advocacy, end of life care, conflicts, balancing technology and care, and caring for the acute, chronic and emergently ill. Many also reported feeling conflicted in their decision-making or felt they were unable to carry out certain decisions, contributing to the overall feelings of moral distress. Nurse leaders believe that an unhealthy ethical climate may have far more negative implications than anyone realizes and does ultimately affect patient care. It is thought that if healthcare professionals cannot meet their primary objectives with respect to patient care, everyone suffers.</p>\n<p>\n	Information concerning moral and ethical distress is very limited and the impact of the distress on patient care is still somewhat unknown. Dr. Ulrich states that:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue"><p>Improving the ethical climate begins with administration and managerial leaders. First, I believe they have to recognize that nurses and other health care workers are facing tremendous ethical challenges in providing care and encountering stress related to these concerns.

The compassion fatigue stress test was developed by B. Hudnall Stamm and is designed to help you recognize symptoms of compassion fatigue in your life. In addition to the compassion fatigue stress test, B. Hudnall Stamm has also provided additional insight to the significance of test results that will vary dependent upon your answers, they are as follows: compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma stress.</p>\n<h2>Compassion Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Compassion satisfaction is about the pleasure you derive from being able to do your work well. For example, you may feel like it is a pleasure to help others through your work. You may feel positively about your colleagues or your ability to contribute to the work setting or even the greater good of society. Higher scores on this scale represent a greater satisfaction related to your ability to be an effective caregiver in your job.</p>\n<h2>Burnout</h2>\n<p>\n	Most people have an intuitive idea of what burnout is. From the research perspective, burnout is associated with feelings of hopelessness and difficulties in dealing with work or in doing your job effectively. These negative feelings usually have a gradual onset. They can reflect the feeling that your efforts make no difference, or they can be associated with a very high workload or a non-supportive work environment. Higher scores on this scale mean that you are at higher risk for burnout.</p>\n<h2>Compassion Fatigue/Secondary Trauma Stress</h2>\n<p>Compassion fatigue (CF) and secondary trauma stress (STS) is about your work-related, secondary exposure to extremely stressful events. For example, you may repeatedly hear stories about the traumatic things that happen to other people, commonly called vicarious trauma (VT). If your work puts you directly in the path of danger, such as being a soldier or humanitarian aide worker, this is not secondary exposure; your exposure is primary. However, if you are exposed to others’ traumatic events because of your work, such as in an emergency room or working with child protective services, this is secondary exposure. The symptoms of CF/STS are usually rapid in onset and associated with a particular event. They may include being afraid, having difficulty sleeping, having images of the upsetting event pop into your mind, or avoiding things that remind you of the event.</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-red"><h4>Disclaimer:</h4><p>While this test will never replace a qualified medical diagnosis, it may help you to determine if you need to seek further assistance.

Glass, plastic, porcelain, clay, pottery, dry wood, and similar substances generally slow or stop the flow of electricity. They are called “insulators.” Even air, normally an insulator, can become a conductor, as occurs during an arc or lightning stroke.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:174}}</p>\n\n<h2>	Water and Electricity</h2>\n\n<p>Pure water is a poor conductor. But small amounts of impurities in water like salt, acid, solvents, or other materials can turn water itself and substances that generally act as insulators into conductors or better conductors. Dry wood, for example, generally slows or stops the flow of electricity. But when saturated with water, wood turns into a conductor. The same is true of human skin. Dry skin has a fairly high resistance to electric current. But when skin is moist or wet, it acts as a conductor. This means that anyone working with electricity in a damp or wet environment needs to exercise extra caution to prevent electrical hazards.</p>\n\n<h2>Electrical Shocks</h2>\n<p>Electricity travels in closed circuits, normally through a conductor.

An electrical accident can result in an electrical burn, arc burn, thermal contact burn, or a combination of burns.</p>\n<h2>	Electrical Burns</h2>\n<p>Electrical burns are among the most serious burns and require immediate medical attention. They occur when electric current flows through tissues or bone, generating heat that causes tissue damage.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:175}}</p>\n\n<h2>Arc or Flash Burns</h2>\n<p>Arc or flash burns result from high temperatures caused by an electric arc or explosion near the body. These burns should be treated promptly.</p>\n<h2>Thermal Contact Burns</h2>\n<p>Thermal contact burns are caused when the skin touches hot surfaces of overheated electric conductors, conduits, or other energized equipment. Thermal burns also can be caused when clothing catches on fire, as may occur when an electric arc is produced.</p>\n<p>In addition to shock and burn hazards, electricity poses other dangers. For example, arcs that result from short circuits can cause injury or start a fire. Extremely high-energy arcs can damage equipment, causing fragmented metal to fly in all directions. Even low-energy arcs can cause violent explosions in atmospheres that contain flammable gases, vapors, or combustible dusts.</p>\n<h1>Muscle Response to Electrical Shock</h1>\n<p>When a person receives an electrical shock, sometimes the electrical stimulation causes the muscles to contract. This “freezing” effect makes the person unable to pull free of the circuit. It is extremely dangerous because it increases the length of exposure to electricity and because the current causes blisters, which reduce the body’s resistance and increases the current.</p>\n<p>The longer the exposure to the electrical current, the greater the risk of serious injury. Longer exposures at even relatively low voltages can be just as dangerous as short exposures at higher voltages. <i>Low voltage does not imply low hazard.</i></p>\n<p>In addition to muscle contractions that cause “freezing,” electrical shocks also can cause involuntary muscle reactions. These reactions can result in a wide range of other injuries from collisions or falls, including bruises, bone fractures, and even death.</p>\n<p>If a person is “frozen” to a live electrical contact, shut off the current immediately. If this is not possible, use boards, poles, or sticks made of wood or any other nonconducting materials and safely push or pull the person away from the contact. It’s important to act quickly, but remember to protect yourself from electrocution or shock.</p>\n<p>A severe shock can cause considerably more damage than meets the eye. A victim may suffer internal hemorrhages and destruction of tissues, nerves, and muscles that aren’t readily visible. Renal damage also can occur. If you or a coworker receives a shock, seek emergency medical help immediately.</p>\n', 4, 188, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(148, 'ms0110_05', '<h1>Static Electricity</h1><p>Static electricity also can cause a shock, though in a different way and generally not as potentially severe as the type of shock described previously. Static electricity can build up on the surface of an object and, under the right conditions, can discharge to a person, causing a shock. The most familiar example of this is when a person reaches for a doorknob or other metal object on a cold, relatively dry day and receives a shock.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:176}}</p>\n\n<p>However, static electricity also can cause shocks or can just discharge to an object with much more serious consequences, as when friction causes a high level of static electricity to build up at a specific spot on an object. This can happen simply through handling plastic pipes and materials or during normal operation of rubberized drive or machine belts found in many worksites. In these cases, for example, static electricity can potentially discharge when sufficient amounts of flammable or combustible substances are located nearby and cause an explosion. Grounding or other measures may be necessary to prevent this static electricity buildup and the results.</p>\n<h1>Protection Against Electrical Hazards</h1>\n<p>Most electrical accidents result from one of the following three factors:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ol>\n	<li>Unsafe equipment or installation,</li>\n	<li>Unsafe environment, or</li>\n	<li>Unsafe work practices.</li>\n</ol></div>\n<p>Some ways to prevent these accidents are through the use of insulation, guarding, grounding, electrical protective devices, and safe work practices.</p>\n<h2>Insulation Protection</h2>\n<p>Insulators such as glass, mica, rubber, or plastic used to coat metals and other conductors help stop or reduce the flow of electrical current. This helps prevent shock, fires, and short circuits. To be effective, the insulation must be suitable for the voltage used and conditions such as temperature and other environmental factors like moisture, oil, gasoline, corrosive fumes, or other substances that could cause the insulator to fail.</p>\n<h3>Types of Insulation</h3>\n<p>Insulation on conductors is often color-coded. Insulated equipment grounding conductors usually are either solid green or green with yellow stripes. Insulation covering grounded conductors is generally white or gray. Ungrounded conductors, or “hot wires,” often are black or red, although they may be any color other than green, white, or gray.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:177}}</p>\n<p>Before connecting electrical equipment to a power source, it’s a good idea to check the insulation for any exposed wires for possible defects. Insulation covering flexible cords such as extension cords is particularly vulnerable to damage.</p>\n<p>Subpart S of 29 CFR 1910.302 regulates the insulation that covers conductors in non-construction applications through 1910.308, Wiring Design and Protection. Subpart S generally requires insulation on circuit conductors. It also specifies that the insulation used should be suitable for the voltage and conditions.

	(149, 'ms0110_06', '<h2>Guarding Electrical Equipment</h2><p>Guarding involves locating or enclosing electric equipment to make sure people don’t accidentally come into contact with its live parts. Effective guarding requires equipment with exposed parts operating at 50 volts or more to be placed where it is accessible only to authorized people qualified to work with it. Recommended locations are a room, vault, or similar enclosure; a balcony, gallery, or elevated platform; or a site elevated 8 feet (2.44 meters) or more above the floor. Sturdy, permanent screens also can serve as effective guards.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:178}}</p>\n\n<p>Conspicuous signs must be posted at the entrances to electrical rooms and similarly guarded locations to alert people to the electrical hazard and to forbid entry to unauthorized people.

HHLEARN has a large selection of free downloadable signs that meet OSHA guidelines in the resources area.</p>\n<h2>Electrical Grounding</h2>\n<p>“Grounding” a tool or electrical system means intentionally creating a low-resistance path that connects to the earth. This prevents the buildup of voltages that could cause an electrical accident.</p>\n\n<p>Grounding is normally a secondary protective measure to protect against electric shock. It does <u>not</u> guarantee that you won’t get a shock or be injured or killed by an electrical current. It will, however, substantially reduce the risk, especially when used in combination with other safety measures discussed in this course.</p>\n<p>29 CFR, Part 1910.304, Subpart S, Wiring Design and Protection, requires at times a service or system ground and an equipment ground in non-construction applications.</p>\n<p>A <i>service</i> or <i>system</i> ground is designed primarily to protect machines, tools, and insulation against damage. One wire, called the “neutral” or “grounded” conductor, is grounded. In an ordinary low-voltage circuit, the white or gray wire is grounded at the generator or transformer and at the building’s service entrance.</p>\n<p>An <i>equipment</i> ground helps protect the equipment operator. It furnishes a second path for the current to pass through from the tool or machine to the ground. This additional ground safeguards the operator if a malfunction causes the tool’s metal frame to become energized. The resulting flow of current may activate the circuit protection devices.</p>\n', 6, 167, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(150, 'ms0110_07', '<h3>Circuit Protection Devices</h3><p>Circuit protection devices limit or stop the flow of current automatically in the event of a ground fault, overload, or short circuit in the wiring system. Well-known examples of these devices are fuses, circuit breakers, ground-fault circuit interrupters, and arc-fault circuit interrupters.</p>\n<p>Fuses and circuit breakers open or break the circuit automatically when too much current flows through them. When that happens, fuses melt and circuit breakers trip the circuit open. Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to protect conductors and equipment. They prevent wires and other components from overheating and open the circuit when there is a risk of a ground fault.</p>\n<p>Ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are used in wet locations, construction sites, and other high-risk areas (e.g., kitchens, bathrooms, and garages). These devices interrupt the flow of electricity within as little as 1/40th of a second to prevent electrocution. GFCIs compare the amount of current going into electric equipment with the amount of current returning from it along the circuit conductors. If the difference exceeds 5 milliamperes, the device automatically shuts off the electric power.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:179}}</p>\n\n<p>Arc-fault devices provide protection from the effects of arc-faults by recognizing characteristics unique to arcing and by functioning to deenergize the circuit when an arc-fault is detected.</p>\n', 7, 97, 1, NULL, NULL),

Touching these energized parts can result in an electrical shock, burn, or electrocution. The best way to protect yourself when using electrical tools or machines is to establish a low-resistance path from the device’s metallic case to the ground. This requires an equipment-grounding conductor, a low-resistance wire that directs unwanted current directly to the ground. A properly installed grounding conductor has a low resistance to ground and greatly reduces the amount of current that passes through your body. Cord and plug equipment with a three-prong plug is a common example of equipment incorporating this ground conductor.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:180}}</p>\n\n<p>Another form of protection is to use listed or labeled portable tools and appliances protected by an approved system of double insulation or its equivalent. Where such a system is employed, it must be marked distinctively to indicate that the tool or appliance uses an approved double insulation system.</p>\n<h1>Lockout/Tagout</h1>\n<p>Proper lockout/tagout procedures protect you from the dangers of the accidental or unexpected startup of electrical equipment and are required for general industry by OSHA Standard 1910.333, Selection and Use of Work Practices. Requirements for construction applications are in 29 CFR 1926.417, Lockout and Tagging of Circuits. These procedures ensure that electrical equipment is deenergized before it is repaired or inspected and protects you against electrocution or shock.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:181}}</p>\n\n<p>The first step before beginning any inspection or repair job is to turn the current off at the switch box and padlock the switch in the OFF position. This applies even on so-called low-voltage circuits. Securely tagging the switch or controls of the machine or equipment being locked out of service clarifies to everyone in the area which equipment or circuits are being inspected or repaired.</p>\n<p>Only qualified electricians who have been trained in safe lockout procedures should maintain electrical equipment. No two of the locks used should match, and each key should fit just one lock. In addition, one individual lock and key should be issued to each maintenance worker authorized to lock out and tag the equipment. All employees who repair a given piece of equipment should lock out its switch with an individual lock. Only authorized workers should be permitted to remove it.

Office workers and healthcare providers work with electricity indirectly and may also be exposed to electrical hazards.</p>\n<h2>Generators</h2>\n<p>One of the common tools utilized following the loss of power are portable generators. Most generators are gasoline powered and use internal combustion engines to produce electricity. Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas\rproduced during the operation of gasoline-powered generators. When inhaled, the gas reduces your ability to utilize oxygen.

	(153, 'ms0101_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are the cornerstone of chemical hazard communication and central to the safe handling of hazardous substances.

By June 1, 2015, chemical manufacturers, importers, distributors, and employers must comply with all modified provisions of the HCS final rule, but distributors may ship products labeled by manufacturers under the old system until December 1, 2015. By June 1, 2016, {{LOCATION:NAME}} must update alternative workplace labeling and hazard communication programs as necessary, and provide additional employee training for newly identified physical or health hazards.

The MSDS contains much more information about the material than the label on the container.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:153}}</p>\n\n\n<p>Most materials packaged for <i>consumer</i> use are exempt from the requirements of the Occupation Safety and Health Organization’s (OSHA’s) Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). The MSDS should include precautions for normal use, handling, storage, disposal, and spill cleanup. It should <u>not</u> include recommendations for protective measures that are stricter than needed. Government regulations require that MSDSs be readily available to all workers. OSHA mandates that MSDSs be prepared and written by the manufacturer of the material.</p>\n\n<h1>	History</h1>\n<p>In the 1940s, the Manufacturing Chemists\' Association, now known as the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), began producing "Chemical Safety Data Sheets" containing "Properties and Essential Information for Safe Handling and Use" of some of the more important hazardous chemicals used in commerce. Ultimately, about 100 of these data sheets were produced. They were very detailed in their coverage of each chemical, to the point of being almost a standalone book on the product. The longest Chemical Safety Data Sheet was 46 pages. Later, some chemical companies began to produce data sheets for some of their high volume or hazardous chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>On November 25, 1983, OSHA published the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) as 29 CFR Part 1910.1200. This initial standard applied only to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) divisions 20 through 39 (the manufacturing division). The requirement that manufacturers and distributors provide MSDSs to their customers became effective on November 25, 1985. The HCS does <u>not</u> require a particular format for the MSDS, but does specify what information must be included. Effective September 23, 1987, the requirements of the standard were extended to include, "... all employers with employees exposed to hazardous chemicals in their workplaces."</p>\n\n<p>In 1986, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the "Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986," and in 1988, "Toxic Chemical Release Reporting: Community Right-To-Know." The use and distribution of MSDSs is an important part of these regulations. The "Toxic Chemical Release Reporting" regulation requires that MSDSs for chemicals requiring reporting by these regulations contain specific language notifying users that these chemicals are subject to these regulations. These, and other EPA regulations, have been promulgated under Title III C Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (EPCRA).</p>\n\n<p>OSHA’s definition of a hazardous chemical is broad, and includes many materials that might otherwise be considered harmless. <i>Because of the potential for product liability suits, and the demands of customers for MSDSs for almost all materials they purchase, manufacturers usually prepare MSDSs for even relatively harmless materials</i>.</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-red"><h4>Alert:</h4>\n                <p>OSHA requires manufacturers and importers of hazardous chemicals to distribute Material Safety Data Sheets with information concerning reasonably foreseeable health and toxicity concerns arising from their use.

The HIV epidemic remains a major global public health challenge, with an approximate 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.

It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Unlike some other viruses, the human body cannot get rid of HIV. That means that once you have HIV, you have it for life. It is the virus that can lead to <b>a</b>cquired <b>i</b>mmune <b>d</b>eficiency <b>s</b>yndrome, or AIDS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 50,000 people in the United States get infected with HIV each year. In 2010, there were around 47,500 new HIV infections in the United States.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:125}}</p>\n\n<p>No safe and effective cure currently exists, but scientists are working hard to find one, and remain hopeful. Meanwhile, with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. Treatment for HIV is often called antiretroviral therapy or ART. It can dramatically prolong the lives of many people infected with HIV and lower their chance of infecting others. Before the introduction of ART in the mid-1990s, people with HIV could progress to AIDS in just a few years. Today, someone diagnosed with HIV and treated before the disease is far advanced can have a nearly normal life expectancy.</p>\n<p>HIV affects specific cells of the immune system, called CD4 cells, or T cells. Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these cells that the body can’t fight off infections and disease. When this happens, HIV infection leads to AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>HIV disease has a well-documented progression. Untreated, HIV is almost universally fatal because it eventually overwhelms the immune system—resulting in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV treatment helps people at all stages of the disease, and treatment can slow or prevent progression from one stage to the next.</p>\n\n<p>A person can transmit HIV to others during any of these stages:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<h4>Acute infection</h4>\r\r<p>Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, an individual may feel sick with flu-like symptoms. This is called acute retroviral syndrome (ARS) or primary HIV infection, and it’s the body’s natural response to the HIV infection. (Not everyone develops ARS, however—and some people may have no symptoms.)</p>\r\r<p>During this period of infection, large amounts of HIV are being produced in the body. The virus uses important immune system cells called CD4 cells to make copies of itself and destroys these cells in the process. Because of this, the CD4 count can fall quickly.</p>\r\r<p>An individual’s ability to spread HIV is highest during this stage because the amount of virus in the blood is very high.</p>\r\r<p>Eventually, the immune response will begin to bring the amount of virus in the body back down to a stable level. At this point, the CD4 count will then begin to increase, but it may not return to pre-infection levels.</p>\r\r<h4>Clinical Latency (Inactivity or Dormancy)</h4>\r\r<p>This period is sometimes called asymptomatic HIV infection or chronic HIV infection. During this phase, HIV is still active, but reproduces at very low levels. The individual may not have any symptoms or get sick during this time. People who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may live with clinical latency for several decades. For people who are not on ART, this period can last up to a decade, but some may progress through this phase faster. It is important to remember that the individual is still able to transmit HIV to others during this phase even if they are treated with ART, although ART greatly reduces the risk. Toward the middle and end of this period, the viral load begins to rise and their CD4 cell count begins to drop. As this happens, they may begin to have symptoms of HIV infection as their immune system becomes too weak to protect them.</p>\r\r<h4>AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)</h4>\r\r<p>This is the stage of infection that occurs when the immune system is badly damaged and the individual becomes vulnerable to infections and infection-related cancers called opportunistic illnesses. When the number of CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), the individual is considered to have progressed to AIDS. (Normal CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.) An individual can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they develop one or more opportunistic illnesses, regardless of their CD4 count. Without treatment, people who are diagnosed with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. People with AIDS need medical treatment to prevent death.</p>\n</div>\r\r<p>Most reports of a cure involve HIV-infected people who needed treatment for a cancer that would have killed them otherwise. But these treatments are very risky, even life-threatening, and are used only when the HIV-infected people would have died without them. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), however, can dramatically prolong the lives of many people infected with HIV and lower their chance of infecting others. It is important that people get tested for HIV and know that they are infected early so that medical care and treatment have the greatest effect.</p>\r\r<h2>HIV Etiology</h2>\r\r<p>Scientists identified a type of chimpanzee in West Africa as the source of HIV infection in humans. They believe that the chimpanzee version of the immunodeficiency virus (called simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV) most likely was transmitted to humans and mutated into HIV when humans hunted these chimpanzees for meat and came into contact with their infected blood. Studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s. Over decades, the virus slowly spread across Africa and later into other parts of the world. We know that the virus has existed in the United States since at least the mid to late 1970s.</p>', 1, 485, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(164, 'ds-b20_02', '<h2>HIV Transmission</h2><p>Myths persist about how HIV is transmitted. This section provides the facts about HIV risk from different types of sex, injection drug use, and other activities.</p>\r\r<p>In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by having sex or sharing injection drug equipment such as needles with someone who has HIV. Only certain fluids—blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from an HIV-infected person can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to possibly occur. Mucous membranes can be found inside the rectum, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the mouth.</p>\r\r<p>In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Having sex with someone who has HIV. In general:\n	<ul>\r<li>Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. Receptive anal sex (bottoming) is riskier than insertive anal sex (topping).\r<li>Vaginal sex is the second highest-risk sexual behavior.\r<li>Having multiple sex partners or having other sexually transmitted infections can increase the risk of infection through sex.\n	</ul>\r<li>Sharing needles, syringes, rinse water, or other equipment (works) used to prepare injection drugs with someone who has HIV.\r</ul></div>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:915}}</p>\r\r<p>Less commonly, HIV may be spread by:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ul>\r<li>Being born to an infected mother. HIV can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.\r<li>Being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers.\r<li>Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues.\r<li>Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing, and is very rare.\r<li>Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken.\r<li>Oral sex—using the mouth to stimulate the penis, vagina, or anus (fellatio, cunnilingus, and rimming). Giving fellatio (mouth to penis oral sex) and having the person ejaculate (cum) in your mouth is riskier than other types of oral sex.\r<li>Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.

This means there are many different strains of HIV, even within the body of a single infected person. Based on genetic similarities, the numerous virus strains may be classified into types, groups, and subtypes.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. Both types are transmitted by sexual contact, through blood, and from mother to child, and they appear to cause clinically indistinguishable AIDS. However, it seems that HIV-2 is less easily transmitted, and the period between initial infection and illness is longer in the case of HIV-2.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:126}}</p>\n\n<p>Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1, and generally when people refer to HIV without specifying the type of virus they will be referring to HIV-1.

These four groups may represent four separate introductions of simian immunodeficiency virus into humans.</p>\n\n<p>Group O appears to be restricted to west-central Africa and group N—a strain discovered in 1998 in Cameroon—is extremely rare. In 2009 a new strain closely relating to gorilla simian immunodeficiency virus was discovered in a Cameroonian woman. It was designated HIV-1 group P.<sup>1</sup> More than 90 percent of HIV-1 infections belong to HIV-1 group M and, unless specified, the rest of this page will relate to HIV-1 group M only.</p>\r\r<p>Within group M there are known to be at least nine genetically distinct subtypes (or clades) of HIV-1. These are subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J and K.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\r<p>Occasionally, two viruses of different subtypes can meet in the cell of an infected person and mix together their genetic material to create a new hybrid virus (a process similar to sexual reproduction, and sometimes called "viral sex").<sup>3</sup> Many of these new strains do not survive for long, but those that infect more than one person are known as "circulating recombinant forms" or CRFs. For example, the CRF A/B is a mixture of subtypes A and B.</p>\r\r<p>The classification of HIV strains into subtypes and CRFs is a complex issue and the definitions are subject to change as new discoveries are made. Some scientists talk about subtypes A1, A2, A3, F1 and F2 instead of A and F, though others regard the former as sub-subtypes.</p>\r\r<h3>Subtypes E & I</h3>\r\r<p>One of the CRFs is called A/E because it is thought to have resulted from hybridization between subtype A and some other "parent" subtype E. However, no one has ever found a pure form of subtype E. Confusingly, many people still refer to the CRF A/E as "subtype E" (in fact it is most correctly called CRF01_AE).<sup>4</sup></p>\r\r<p>A virus isolated in Cyprus was originally placed in a new subtype I, before being reclassified as a recombinant form A/G/I. It is now thought that this virus represents an even more complex CRF comprised of subtypes A, G, H, K, and unclassified regions.

This section answers some of the most common questions related to HIV testing, including the types of tests available, where to get one, and what to expect when you go to get tested.</p>\n\n<p>Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), tests are classified according to the complexity of the test. CLIA-waived tests are simple tests for which the likelihood of erroneous test results is negligible.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:916}}</p>\n\n<p>The immune system usually takes 3 to 8 weeks to make antibodies against HIV, but tests differ in how early they are able to detect antibodies. Although most HIV tests look for these antibodies, some look for the virus itself. The period after infection but before the test becomes positive is called the window period.</p>\n\n<p>Deciding when to get tested therefore depends on when you may have been exposed and which test is used. You can ask your health care provider about the window period for the HIV test you are taking. If you are using a home test, you can get that information from the materials included in the packaging of the test.</p>\r\r<p>A few people will have a longer window period, so if you get a negative antibody test result in the first 3 months after possible exposure, you should get a repeat test after 3 months. Ninety-seven percent of people will develop antibodies in the first 3 months after they are infected. In very rare cases, it can take up to 6 months to develop antibodies to HIV.</p>\n\r\n<h2>HIV Test Types</h2>\n<p>The most common HIV test is the <b>antibody screening test</b> (immunoassay), which tests for the antibodies that the body makes against HIV. The immunoassay may be conducted in a lab or as a rapid test at the testing site. It may be performed on blood or oral fluid (not saliva). Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, blood tests tend to find infection sooner after exposure than do oral fluid tests. In addition, most blood-based lab tests find infection sooner after exposure than rapid HIV tests.</p>\n\n<p>Several tests are being used more commonly that can detect both <b>antibodies and antigen</b> (part of the virus itself). These tests can find recent infection earlier than tests that detect only antibodies. These antigen/antibody combination tests can find HIV as soon as 3 weeks after exposure to the virus, but they are only available for testing blood, not oral fluid.</p>\r\r<p>The <b>rapid test</b> is an immunoassay used for screening, and it produces quick results, in 30 minutes or less. Rapid tests use blood or oral fluid to look for antibodies to HIV. If an immunoassay (lab test or rapid test) is conducted during the window period (i.e., the period after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test may <u>not</u> find antibodies and may give a false-negative result. All immunoassays that are positive need a follow-up test to confirm the result.</p>\r\r<p><b>Follow-up diagnostic testing</b> is performed if the first immunoassay result is positive. Follow-up tests include: an antibody differentiation test, which distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2; an HIV-1 nucleic acid test, which looks for virus directly; or the Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay, which detect antibodies.</p>\r\r<p>Immunoassays are generally very accurate, but follow-up testing allows the individual and their health care provider to be sure the diagnosis is right. If the first test is a rapid test, and it is positive, the individual will be directed to a medical setting to get follow-up testing. If the first test is a lab test, and it is positive, the lab will conduct follow-up testing, usually on the same blood specimen as the first test.</p>\r\r<p>Currently there are only two home HIV tests: the Home Access HIV-1 Test System and the OraQuick In-home HIV test. If buying a home test online, make sure the HIV test is FDA-approved.</p>\r\r<p>The <b>Home Access HIV-1 Test System</b> is a home collection kit, which involves pricking the finger to collect a blood sample, sending the sample to a licensed laboratory, and then calling in for results as early as the next business day. This test is anonymous. If the test is positive, a follow-up test is performed right away, and the results include the follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to treatment. The tests conducted on the blood sample collected at home find infection later after infection than most lab-based tests using blood from a vein, but earlier than tests conducted with oral fluid.</p>\r\r<p>The <b>OraQuick In-Home HIV Test</b> provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing the mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If an individual tests positive, they will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 people may test false-negative with this test.</p>\r\r<p><b>RNA tests</b> detect the virus directly (instead of the antibodies to HIV) and thus can detect HIV at about 10 days after infection—as soon as it appears in the bloodstream, before antibodies develop. These tests cost more than antibody tests and are generally <u>not</u> used as a screening test, although an individual’s doctor may order one as a follow-up test, after a positive antibody test, or as part of a clinical workup.</p>\r\r<h3>Taking the Test</h3>\r\r<p>When it’s time to take the test, a health care provider will take the sample (blood or oral fluid) and the individual may be able to wait for the results (if it’s a rapid HIV test). If the test comes back negative, and they haven’t had an exposure for 3 months, they can be confident they’re not infected with HIV.</p>\r\r<p>If a test comes back positive, they will need to get a follow-up test, which the testing site will arrange.</p>\r\r<p>Health care providers or counselors may talk with the individual about their risk factors, answer questions about their general health, and discuss next steps with them, especially if their result is positive.</p>\r\r<h3>HIV Testing & Pregnancy</h3>\r\r<p>HIV testing during each pregnancy is important because, if your result is positive, treatment can improve your health and greatly lower the chance that you will pass HIV to your infant before, during, or after birth. The treatment is most effective for preventing HIV transmission to babies when started as early as possible during pregnancy. However, there are still great health benefits to beginning preventive treatment even during labor or shortly after the baby is born.</p>\r\r<p>CDC recommends that health care providers screen all pregnant women for HIV, talk to them about HIV or give them written materials, and, for women with risk factors, provide referrals to prevention counseling.</p>\r\r<p>Screening all pregnant women for HIV, and giving them the right medical care, helped decrease the number of babies born with HIV from a high of 1,650 in 1991 to 127 in 2011.</p>', 4, 475, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(167, 'ds-b20_05', '<h2>HIV Prevention</h2><p>Today, more tools than ever are available to prevent HIV. In addition to limiting the number of sexual partners, never sharing needles, and using condoms correctly and consistently, an individual may be able to take advantage of newer biomedical options such as pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis.</p>\r\r<p>Prevention measures include:\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. Oral sex is much less risky than anal or vaginal sex. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for HIV transmission. If you are HIV-negative, insertive anal sex (topping) is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex (bottoming). Sexual activities that do not involve the potential exchange of bodily fluids carry <u>no</u> risk for getting HIV (e.g., touching).\r<li>Using condoms consistently and correctly.\r<li>Reducing the number of people you have sex with. The number of sex partners you have affects your HIV risk. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with HIV whose viral load is not suppressed or to have a sex partner with a sexually transmitted disease. Both of these factors can increase the risk of HIV transmission.\r<li>Talking to your doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), taking HIV medicine daily to prevent HIV infection, if you are at substantial risk for HIV. PrEP should be considered if you are HIV-negative and in an ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV-positive partner. PrEP also should be considered if you are not in an exclusive relationship with a recently tested, HIV-negative partner and are a:\n	<ul>\r<li>gay or bisexual man who has had anal sex without a condom or been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months; or\r<li>heterosexual man or woman who does not regularly use condoms during sex with partners of unknown HIV status who are at substantial risk of HIV infection (e.g., people who inject drugs or have bisexual male partners).\n	</ul>\r<li>Talking to your doctor right away (within 3 days) about post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if you have a possible exposure to HIV. An example of a possible exposure is if you have anal or vaginal sex without a condom with someone who is or may be HIV-positive, and you are HIV-negative and not taking PrEP. Your chance of exposure to HIV is lower if your HIV-positive partner is taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) consistently and correctly, especially if his/her viral load is undetectable. Starting PEP immediately and taking it daily for 4 weeks reduces the chance of getting HIV.\r<li>Getting tested and treated for other STDs and encouraging your partners to do the same. If you are sexually active, get tested at least once a year. STDs can have long-term health consequences. They can also increase your chance of getting HIV or transmitting it to others. <a href="http://hivtest.cdc.gov/" title="Click to Find STD Testing Site" target="_new">Find an STD testing site</a>.\r<li>If your partner is HIV-positive, encourage your partner to get and stay on treatment. ART reduces the amount of HIV virus (viral load) in blood and body fluids. ART can keep people with HIV healthy for many years, and greatly reduce the chance of transmitting HIV to sex partners if taken consistently and correctly.\n</ul></div>\r\r<p>When used correctly and consistently, condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV infection. Condoms are also effective at preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) transmitted through body fluids, like gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV. However, they provide less protection against STDs spread through skin-to-skin contact like human papillomavirus (genital warts), genital herpes, and syphilis.</p>\r\r<p>There are two types of condoms: male and female.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>Male Condoms</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Latex condoms provide the best protection against HIV. Polyurethane (plastic) or polyisoprene (synthetic rubber) condoms are good options for people with latex allergies. Natural membrane (such as lambskin) condoms are porous, meaning that infections can pass through them, and therefore do not protect as well against HIV and certain other STDs.\r<li>Lubricants can help prevent condoms from breaking. Water-based and silicon-based lubricants are safe to use with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants and products containing oil, such as hand lotion, Vaseline, or Crisco should not be used with latex condoms.\r</ul>\r<h4>Female Condoms</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Female condoms are thin pouches made of a synthetic latex product called nitrile.\r<li>When worn in the vagina, female condoms are just as effective as male condoms at preventing STDs, HIV, and pregnancy. Some people use female condoms for anal sex. However, we do not know how well female condoms prevent HIV and other STDs when used for anal sex. But we do know that HIV cannot travel through the nitrile barrier.\r<li>It is safe to use any kind of lubricant with nitrile female condoms. \r</ul></div>\r<p>Although highly effective when used consistently and correctly, there is still a chance of getting HIV if you only use condoms, so adding other prevention methods can further reduce your risk.</p>', 5, 342, 1, NULL, NULL),

Many communities have programs where individuals can get new needles and syringes, new injection works, and other new supplies, as well as health care services.\r<li>Using only new syringes that come from reliable sources (e.g., pharmacies or syringe service programs/needle-syringe programs).\r<li>Never sharing needles, syringes, or other injection works.\r<li>Cleaning used needles and syringes with bleach <i>only when new ones are not</i> available. Bleaching a used needle and syringe may reduce the risk of HIV but does <u>not</u> eliminate the risk.

See <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/idu/facts/disinfection.pdf" title="Click to View Instructions" target="_new">Syringe Disinfection for Drug Users</a> for more information.\r<li>Using sterile water to prepare drugs. Individuals can buy sterile water from a store. If sterile water is not available, they can use water that has been boiled for 10 minutes or clean tap or bottled water.\r<li>Cleaning the injection site with a new alcohol swab before they inject.\r<li>Being careful not to touch another person’s blood.\r<li>Disposing of needles and syringes safely after one use. Using a sharps container or making sure to keep used needles and syringes away from other people.\r<li>Using condoms correctly and consistently for every act of vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\r<li>Getting an HIV test at least once every year.\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>These steps, promoted in prevention programs for substance users, have helped decrease the new cases of HIV resulting from injection drug use in recent years.</p>\r\r<p>One additional prevention note: If you are likely to be in a situation where alcohol and other kinds of drugs will be used, have a condom with you in case you have sex.</p>\r\r<h3>HIV Blood Testing</h3>\r\r<p>The U.S. blood supply is among the safest in the world.

Since then, healthcare personnel with HIV who are reported without any known risk for HIV infection are to be investigated by state and local health departments using this protocol, as "Cases of Public Health Importance (COPHI)."</p>\r\r<p>Because of the voluntary nature of the reporting system, there is likely underreporting of cases, and the relatively low numbers of documented and possible cases may not reflect the true numbers of cases in the U.S. Documented cases of occupationally acquired HIV are those in which HIV seroconversion is temporally related to an exposure to an HIV-positive source and in which the exposed worker has no reported nonoccupational risk factors for acquisition of HIV. Possible cases of occupationally acquired HIV are those in which a worker is found to be HIV positive, has no known nonoccupational risk factors for HIV, and has opportunities for occupational exposure to blood, body fluids, or HIV-positive laboratory material. Although data was often incomplete and seroconversion after exposure was not documented for these personnel, occupational acquisition of their infection might have been possible.</p>\r\r<p>Of those healthcare personnel for whom case investigations were completed from 1981-2010, 57 had documented seroconversion to HIV following occupational exposures (see table below for occupations).

In other words, 3 of every 1,000 such injuries, if untreated, will result in infection.</p>\r\r<h3>Prevention Strategies</h3>\r\r<p>To prevent transmission of HIV to health care workers in the workplace, CDC offers the following recommendations. \rHealth care workers should assume that the blood and other body fluids from all patients are potentially infectious. They should therefore follow infection control precautions at all times. These precautions include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Routinely using barriers (such as gloves and/or goggles) when anticipating contact with blood or body fluids.\r<li>Immediately washing hands and other skin surfaces after contact with blood or body fluids.\r<li>Carefully handling and disposing of sharp instruments during and after use.\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>Safety devices have been developed to help prevent needlestick injuries. If used properly, these types of devices may reduce the risk of exposure to HIV. Many percutaneous injuries, such as needlesticks and cuts, are related to the disposal of sharp-ended medical devices. All used syringes or other sharp instruments should be routinely placed in “sharps” containers for proper disposal to prevent accidental injuries and risk of HIV transmission.</p>\r\r<p>Although the most important strategy for reducing the risk of occupational HIV transmission is to prevent occupational exposures, plans for post-exposure management of health care personnel should be in place. CDC issued guidelines in 2005 for the management of health care worker exposures to HIV and recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1410}}.</p>\r\r<p>These guidelines outline considerations in determining whether health care workers should receive PEP and in choosing the type of PEP regimen. For most HIV exposures that warrant PEP, a basic 4-week, two-drug (there are several options) regimen is recommended, starting as soon as possible after exposure. For HIV exposures that pose an increased risk of transmission (based on the infection status of the source and the type of exposure), a three-drug regimen may be recommended. Special circumstances, such as a delayed exposure report, unknown source person, pregnancy in the exposed person, resistance of the source virus to antiretroviral agents, and toxicity of PEP regimens, are also discussed in the guidelines. Occupational exposures should be considered urgent medical concerns, and PEP should be started within 72 hours—the sooner the better; every hour counts.</p>', 9, 243, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(172, 'ds-b20_10', '<h1>HIV Treatment</h1><p>In 1987, a drug called AZT became the first approved treatment for HIV disease. Since then, approximately 30 drugs have been approved to treat people living with HIV/AIDS, and more are under development. You may have heard these drugs called many different names, including:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>"The Cocktail"\r<li>Antiretrovirals (ARVs)\r<li>Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART or ART)\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>There are currently five different "classes" of HIV drugs. Each class of drug attacks the virus at different points in its life cycle—so each individual taking HIV meds will generally be taking 3 different antiretroviral drugs from 2 different classes.</p>\r\r<p>This regimen is standard for HIV care—and it’s important. That’s because <i>no drug can cure</i> HIV, and taking a single drug, by itself, won’t stop HIV from harming the individual. Taking 3 different HIV meds does the best job of controlling the amount of virus in the body and protecting the immune system.</p>\r\r<p>Taking more than one drug also protects the individual against HIV drug resistance. When HIV reproduces, it can make copies of itself that are imperfect—and these mutations may not respond to the drugs taken to control HIV. If an individual follows the 3-drug regimen, the HIV in his/her body will be less likely to make new copies that don’t respond to the HIV meds.</p>\r\r<h1>Drug Classification</h1>\r\r<p>Each HIV medication is pretty powerful by itself—and the key to treating HIV disease successfully is to pick the right combination of drugs from the different classes of HIV meds.</p>\r\r<p>Antiretrovirals are separated into different classes by the way an individual drug stops HIV from replicating in the body. The classes include:</p>\r\r<h2>Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)</h2>\r\r<p>Sometimes called "nukes." These drugs work to block a very important step in HIV’s reproduction process. Nukes act as faulty building blocks in production of viral DNA. This blocks HIV’s ability to use a special type of enzyme (reverse transcriptase) to correctly build new genetic material (DNA) that the virus needs to make copies of itself.</p>\r\r<h2>Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)</h2>\r\r<p>These are called "non-nukes." They work in a very similar way to "nukes." Non-nukes also block the enzyme, reverse transcriptase, and prevent HIV from making copies of its own DNA. But unlike the nukes (which work on the genetic material), non-nukes act directly on the enzyme itself to prevent it from functioning correctly.</p>\r\r<h2>Protease Inhibitors (PIs)</h2>\r\r<p>When HIV replicates inside cells, it creates long strands of its own genetic material. These long strands have to be cut into shorter strands in order for HIV to create more copies of itself. The enzyme that acts to cut up these long strands is called protease. Protease inhibitors block this enzyme and prevent those long strands of genetic material from being cut up into functional pieces.</p>\r\r<h2>Entry/Fusion Inhibitors</h2>\r\r<p>These medications work to block the virus from ever entering the cells in the first place. HIV needs a way to attach and bond to CD4 cells, and it does that through special structures on cells called receptor sites. Receptor sites are found on both HIV and CD4 cells (they are found on other types of cells too). Fusion inhibitors can target those sites on either HIV or CD4 cells and prevent HIV from "docking" into your healthy cells.</p>\r \r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:319}}</p>\r<h3>Integrase Inhibitors</h3>\r\r<p>HIV uses the cells’ genetic material to make its own DNA (a process called reverse transcription). Once that happens, the virus has to integrate its genetic material into the genetic material of the cells. This is accomplished by an enzyme called integrase. Integrase inhibitors block this enzyme and prevent the virus from adding its DNA into the DNA in CD4 cells. Preventing this process prevents the virus from replicating and making new viruses.</p>\r\r<h3>Fixed-Dose Combinations</h3>\r\r<p>These are not a separate class of HIV medications but combinations of the above classes and a great advancement in HIV medicine. They include antiretrovirals, which are combinations of 2 or more medications from one or more different classification. These antiretrovirals are combined into one single pill with specific fixed doses of these medicines.</p>\r\r<p>For a complete description of HIV drugs (including photos and brand names), see AIDSmeds.com’s <a href="http://www.aidsmeds.com/list.shtml" title="Click to Navigate to AIDSmeds.com\'s HIV Drug Listing" target="_new">Treatments for HIV and AIDS</a>.</p>', 10, 308, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(173, 'ds-b20_11', '<h2>Approved Medications to Treat HIV Infection</h2><p>Anti-HIV medications (also called Antiretroviral Therapy or ART) do not kill HIV. They are used to block the virus from replicating and infecting new cells. ART is a combination of different types or classes of HIV medications that stop the virus in different ways. Although these medications do not cure HIV, individuals who take them as prescribed can keep their immune systems strong, greatly reduce the progression of HIV, and decrease their risk of transmitting HIV to others.</p>\n\n<table align="center" border="1">\n	<thead>\n		<tr>\n			<th bgcolor="#0054a6" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n				<font

	(174, 'ds-b20_12', '<h1>AIDS and the Nervous System</h1><p>The HIV virus does <u>not</u> appear to directly invade nerve cells, <i>but</i> it jeopardizes their health and function. The resulting inflammation may damage the brain and spinal cord and cause symptoms such as confusion and forgetfulness, behavioral changes, headaches, progressive weakness, and loss of sensation in the arms and legs. Cognitive motor impairment or damage to the peripheral nerves is also common. Research has shown that the HIV infection can significantly alter the size of certain brain structures involved in learning and information processing.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:127}}</p>\r\r<p>Other nervous system complications that occur as a result of the disease or the drugs used to treat it include pain, seizures, shingles, spinal cord problems, lack of coordination, difficult or painful swallowing, anxiety disorder, depression, fever, vision loss, gait disorders, destruction of brain tissue, and coma. These symptoms may be mild in the early stages of AIDS, but can become progressively severe.</p>\r\r<p>In the United States, neurological complications are seen in more than 50 percent of adult patients with AIDS. Nervous system complications in children may include developmental delays, loss of previously achieved milestones, brain lesions, nerve pain, smaller than normal skull size, slow growth, eye problems, and recurring bacterial infections.</p>\r\r<h1>AIDS Neurological Complications</h1>\r\r<p>AIDS-related disorders of the nervous system may be caused directly by the HIV virus, by certain cancers and opportunistic infections (illnesses caused by bacteria, fungi, and other viruses that would not otherwise affect people with healthy immune systems), or by toxic effects of the drugs used to treat symptoms. Other neuro-AIDS disorders of unknown origin may be influenced by, but are not caused directly by, the virus.</p>\r\r<h2>AIDS Dementia Complex</h2>\r\r<p>AIDS dementia complex (ADC), or HIV-associated dementia (HAD), occurs primarily in persons with more advanced HIV infection. Symptoms include encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), behavioral changes, and a gradual decline in cognitive function, including trouble with concentration, memory, and attention. Persons with ADC also show progressive slowing of motor function and loss of dexterity and coordination. When left untreated, ADC can be fatal. It is rare when anti-retroviral therapy is used. Milder cognitive complaints are common and are termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Neuropsychologic testing can reveal subtle deficits even in the absence of symptoms.</p>\r\r<h2>Central Nervous System Lymphomas</h2>\r\r<p>Central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas are cancerous tumors that either begin in the brain or result from a cancer that has spread from another site in the body. CNS lymphomas are almost always associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms include headache, seizures, vision problems, dizziness, speech disturbance, paralysis, and mental deterioration. AIDS patients may develop one or more CNS lymphomas. Prognosis is poor due to advanced and increasing immunodeficiency, but is better with successful HIV therapy.</p>\r\r<h2>Cryptococcal Meningitis</h2>\r\r<p>Cryptococcal meningitis is seen in about 10 percent of untreated AIDS patients and in other persons whose immune systems have been severely suppressed by disease or drugs. It is caused by the fungus <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, which is commonly found in dirt and bird droppings. The fungus first invades the lungs and spreads to the covering of the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, headache, nausea, memory loss, confusion, drowsiness, and vomiting. If left untreated, patients with cryptococcal meningitis may lapse into a coma and die.</p>\r\r<h2>Cytomegalovirus Infections</h2>\r\r<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can occur concurrently with other infections. Symptoms of CMV encephalitis include weakness in the arms and legs, problems with hearing and balance, altered mental states, dementia, peripheral neuropathy, coma, and retinal disease that may lead to blindness. CMV infection of the spinal cord and nerves can result in weakness in the lower limbs and some paralysis, severe lower back pain, and loss of bladder function. It can also cause pneumonia and gastrointestinal disease. This is rarely seen in HIV-treated individuals since advanced immunity is required for CMV to emerge.</p>', 12, 299, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(175, 'ds-b20_13', '<h2>Herpes Virus Infections</h2><p>Herpes virus infections are often seen in AIDS patients. The herpes zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles, can infect the brain and produce encephalitis and myelitis. It commonly produces shingles, which is an eruption of blisters and intense pain along an area of skin supplied by an infected nerve. In people exposed to herpes zoster, the virus can lay dormant in the nerve tissue for years until it is reactivated as shingles. This reactivation is common in persons with AIDS because of their weakened immune systems. Signs of shingles include painful blisters (like those seen in chickenpox), itching, tingling, and pain in the nerves.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:128}}</p>\r\r<h2>Neuropathies</h2>\r\r<p>Individuals with AIDS may suffer from several different forms of neuropathy, or nerve pain, each strongly associated with a specific stage of active immunodeficiency disease. Peripheral neuropathy describes damage to the peripheral nerves, the vast communications network that transmits information between the brain and spinal cord to every other part of the body. Peripheral nerves also send sensory information back to the brain and spinal cord. HIV damages the nerve fibers that help conduct signals and can cause several different forms of neuropathy. Distal sensory polyneuropathy causes either a numbing feeling or a mild to painful burning or tingling sensation that normally begins in the legs and feet. These sensations may be particularly strong at night and may spread to the hands. Affected persons have a heightened sensitivity to pain, touch, or other stimuli. Onset usually occurs in the later stages of the HIV infection and may affect the majority of advanced-stage HIV patients.</p>\r\r<h2>Neurosyphilis</h2>\r\r<p>Neurosyphilis, the result of an insufficiently treated syphilis infection, seems more frequent and more rapidly progressive in people with HIV infection. It may cause slow degeneration of the nerve cells and nerve fibers that carry sensory information to the brain. Symptoms, which may not appear for some decades after the initial infection and vary from person to person, include weakness, diminished reflexes, unsteady gait, progressive degeneration of the joints, loss of coordination, episodes of intense pain and disturbed sensation, personality changes, dementia, deafness, visual impairment, and impaired response to light. The disease is more frequent in men than in women. Onset is common during mid-life.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:129}}</p>\r\r<h2>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</h2>\r\r<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) primarily affects individuals with suppressed immune systems (including nearly 5 percent of people with AIDS). PML is caused by the JC virus, which travels to the brain, infects multiple sites, and destroys the cells that make myelin. Symptoms include various types of mental deterioration, vision loss, speech disturbances, ataxia, paralysis, brain lesions, and, ultimately, coma. Some patients may also have compromised memory and cognition, and seizures may occur. PML is relentlessly progressive and death usually occurs within 6 months of initial symptoms. However, immune reconstitution with highly active antiretroviral therapy allows survival of more than half of HIV-associated PML cases in the current treatment era.</p>', 13, 225, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(176, 'ds-b20_14', '<h2>Psychological and Neuropsychiatric Disorders</h2><p>Psychological and neuropsychiatric disorders can occur in different phases of the HIV infection and AIDS, and may take various and complex forms. Some illnesses, such as AIDS dementia complex, are caused directly by HIV infection of the brain, while other conditions may be triggered by the drugs used to combat the infection. Individuals may experience anxiety disorder, depressive disorders, increased thoughts of suicide, paranoia, dementia, delirium, cognitive impairment, confusion, hallucinations, behavioral abnormalities, malaise, and acute mania.</p>\r\r<h2>Toxoplasma Encephalitis</h2>\r\r<p>Toxoplasma encephalitis, also called cerebral toxoplasmosis, occurs in about 10 percent of untreated AIDS patients. It is caused by the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, which is carried by cats, birds, and other animals and can be found in soil contaminated by cat feces and sometimes in raw or undercooked meat. Once the parasite invades the immune system, it remains there; however, the immune system in a healthy person can fight off the parasite, preventing disease. Symptoms include encephalitis, fever, severe headache that does not respond to treatment, weakness on one side of the body, seizures, lethargy, increased confusion, vision problems, dizziness, problems with speaking and walking, vomiting, and personality changes. Not all patients show signs of the infection. Antibiotic therapy, if used early, will generally control the complication.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:130}}</p>\r\r<h2>Vacuolar Myelopathy</h2>\r\r<p>Vacuolar myelopathy causes the protective myelin sheath to pull away from nerve cells of the spinal cord, forming small holes called vacuoles in nerve fibers. Symptoms include weak and stiff legs and unsteadiness when walking. Walking becomes more difficult as the disease progresses and many patients eventually require a wheelchair. Some patients also develop AIDS dementia. Vacuolar myelopathy may affect up to 30 percent of untreated adults with AIDS and its incidence may be even higher in HIV-infected children.</p>', 14, 146, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(177, 'ds-b20_15', '<h1>Diagnosing Neurological Disorders</h1><p>Based on the results of the patient’s medical history and a general physical exam, the physician will conduct a thorough neurological exam to assess various functions: motor and sensory skills, nerve function, hearing and speech, vision, coordination and balance, mental status, and changes in mood or behavior. The physician may order laboratory tests and one or more of the following procedures to help diagnose neurological complications of AIDS.</p>\r\r<p>Computer-assisted imaging can reveal signs of brain inflammation, tumors and CNS lymphomas, nerve damage, internal bleeding or hemorrhage, white matter irregularities, and other brain abnormalities. Several painless imaging procedures are used to help diagnose neurological complications of AIDS.</p>\r\r<p>Computed tomography (CT) uses x-rays and a computer to produce two-dimensional images of bone and tissue, including inflammation, certain brain tumors and cysts, brain damage from head injury, and other disorders. It provides more details than an x-ray alone.</p>\r\r<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a computer, radio waves, and a powerful magnetic field to produce either a detailed three-dimensional picture or a two-dimensional “slice” of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves. It does <u>not</u> use ionizing radiation (as does an x-ray) and gives physicians a better look at tissue located near bone.</p>\r\r<p>Functional MRI (fMRI) uses the blood’s magnetic properties to pinpoint areas of the brain that are active and to note how long they stay active. It can assess brain damage from head injury or degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and can identify and monitor other neurological disorders, including AIDS dementia complex.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:131}}</p>\r\r<p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) uses a strong magnetic field to study the biochemical composition and concentration of hydrogen-based molecules, some of which are very specific to nerve cells, in various brain regions. MRS is being used experimentally to identify brain lesions in people with AIDS.</p>\r\r<p>Electromyography (EMG) is used to diagnose nerve and muscle dysfunction (such as neuropathy and nerve fiber damage caused by the HIV virus) and spinal cord disease. It records spontaneous muscle activity and muscle activity driven by the peripheral nerves.\r\r<p>Biopsy is the removal and examination of tissue from the body. A brain biopsy, which involves the surgical removal of a small piece of the brain or tumor, is used to determine intracranial disorders and tumor type. Unlike most other biopsies, it requires hospitalization. Muscle or nerve biopsies can help diagnose neuromuscular problems, while a brain biopsy can help diagnose a tumor, inflammation, or other irregularity.</p>\r\r<p>Cerebrospinal fluid analysis can detect any bleeding or brain hemorrhage, infections of the brain or spinal cord (such as neurosyphilis), and any harmful buildup of fluid. It can also be used to sample viruses that may be affecting the brain. A sample of the fluid is removed by needle, under local anesthesia, and studied to detect any irregularities.</p>', 15, 211, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(178, 'oc0001_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>On December 29, 1970, President Nixon signed the <i>Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970</i> (OSH Act) into law, establishing OSHA. Coupled with the efforts of employers, workers, safety and health professionals, unions and advocates, OSHA and its state partners have dramatically improved workplace safety, reducing work-related deaths and injuries by more than 65 percent.</p>\r\r<p>In 1970, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the job—about 38 every day. For 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports this number fell to about 4,500 or about 12 workers per day. At the same time, U.S. employment has almost doubled to over 130 million workers at more than 7.2 million worksites. The rate of reported serious workplace injuries and illnesses has also dropped markedly, from 11 per 100 workers in 1972 to 3.5 per 100 workers in 2010.</p>\r\r<p>OSHA’s safety and health standards, including those for asbestos, fall protection, cotton dust, trenching, machine guarding, benzene, lead and bloodborne pathogens have prevented countless work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths. Nevertheless, far too many preventable injuries and fatalities continue to occur. Significant hazards and unsafe conditions still exist in U.S. workplaces; each year more than 3.3 million working men and women suffer a serious job-related injury or illness. Millions more are exposed to toxic chemicals that may cause illnesses years from now.</p>\r\r<p>In addition to the direct impact on individual workers, the negative consequences for America’s economy are substantial. Occupational injuries and illnesses cost American employers more than 53 billion dollars a year—over 1 billion dollars a week—in workers’ compensation costs alone. Indirect costs to employers, including lost productivity, employee training and replacement costs, and time for investigations following injuries can more than double these costs. Workers and their families suffer great emotional and psychological costs, in addition to the loss of wages and the costs of caring for the injured, which further weakens the economy.</p>\r\r{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\r\r<h1>OSHA</h1>\r\r<p>Employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthful workplace for their employees. OSHA’s role is to assure the safety and health of America’s workers by setting and enforcing standards; providing training, outreach, and education; establishing partnerships; and encouraging continual process improvement in workplace safety and health.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:22}}</p>\n\r<p>OSHA establishes and enforces protective standards and reaches out to employers and employees through technical assistance and consultation programs. OSHA and its state partners have approximately 2,200 inspectors and about 550 state consultants, plus complaint discrimination investigators, engineers, physicians, educators, standard writers, and other technical and support personnel spread over more than 10 regional offices and 90 local offices.</p>\r\r<p>OSHA works to assure the safety and health of all of America’s working men and women. Most employees in the nation are under OSHA’s jurisdiction. Other users and recipients of OSHA services include: occupational safety and health professionals, the academic community, lawyers, journalists, and personnel of other government entities. Part of OSHA’s mission is to provide assistance to employers to reduce or eliminate workplace hazards. OSHA provides a vast array of informational and training materials focusing on numerous safety and health hazards in the workplace.</p>\r', 1, 269, 1, NULL, NULL),

Travel pay will be paid at the employee’s regular wage and will be paid for travel to and from the project.  Travel time on non-prevailing wage projects will be paid at the foreman’s regular wage to/from the project.  The crew will be paid one way to the project, which effectively pays the employee &frac12; their regular wage for travel to and from a project.  All projects will be reviewed to ensure that the employee receives fair pay relative to the number of hours worked versus the travel required to get to the project.</p>\n\n<h3>Per Diem – Healthcare Providers &amp; Other Personnel</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Management will determine which projects will require the employee to stay out of town.  Employees will receive per diem for each night spent on the road on non-prevailing wage projects.  The CEO will set the per diem rate.</p>\n\n<p>Prevailing wage projects require employees to receive an average wage that is significantly higher than their regular wage for doing the same work.

It is to your advantage to keep these records up-to-date.  Please notify your supervisor or the Human Resources Department of any changes.</p>\n\n<h2>Bulletin Board</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a company bulletin board, located in each branch, which is the official means of communicating with the employees. Only authorized persons can place or remove items from that bulletin board.

Should an employee fail to return company property, that employee will be required to reimburse the company for any unreturned items. Supervisors are required to perform an exit interview at which time these arrangements are to be accomplished.</p>\n\n<h3>Former Employee Reference</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All requests for employment verifications and references should be forwarded to the Human Resource Department.   Former employee references will be limited to employee’s title, salary, responsibilities, and dates of employment.  Absolutely no information is to be released at the branch office.</p>\n\n<h3>COBRA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The right to COBRA continuation was created by a federal law of 1985.  COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other family members who would otherwise lose health coverage.  Under COBRA you would be eligible to continue under the same medical plan for 18 to 36 months based on your qualifying event.  All premiums are the responsibility of the terminated employee.  COBRA paperwork will be sent out by certified mail at the time of separation.</p>\n\n<h3>Rehire of Former Employees</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We consider for rehire those employees who left voluntarily via resignation with two weeks notice, retirement or through no fault of their own and who were in good standing when they exited.  Re-hire decisions must first be approved by the Human Resource Manager.  If an employee is re-hired within 30 days of leaving the Company, the employee’s original hire date will be used to calculate paid leave eligibility and all employee benefits.  If the employee is rehired after this 30 day period has lapsed, they will be treated as a new hire.</p>', 18, 263, 1, NULL, NULL),

For example, you could ask, "Would you like a hamburger or chicken for dinner?" instead of "What would you like for dinner?"</li>\r<li>Use different words if he or she doesn\'t understand what you say the first time.

This means that many people are aware of how the disease is affecting their memory. Here are tips on how to help someone who knows that he or she has memory problems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Take time to listen. The person may want to talk about the changes he or she is noticing.</li>\r<li>Be as sensitive as you can. Don\'t just correct the person every time he or she forgets something or says something odd. Try to understand that it\'s a struggle for the person to communicate.</li>\r<li>Be patient when someone with dementia has trouble finding the right words or putting feelings into words.</li>\r<li>Help the person find words to express thoughts and feelings. For example, Mrs. D cried after forgetting her garden club meeting. She finally said, "I wish they stopped." Her daughter said, "You wish your friends had stopped by for you." Mrs. D nodded and repeated some of the words. Then Mrs. D said, "I want to go." Her daughter said, "You want to go to the garden club meeting." Again, Mrs. D nodded and repeated the words.</li>\r<li>Be careful not to put words in the person\'s mouth or "fill in the blanks" too quickly.</li>\r<li>As people lose the ability to talk clearly, they may rely on other ways to communicate their thoughts and feelings. For example, their facial expressions may show sadness, anger, or frustration. Grasping at their undergarments may tell you they need to use the bathroom.</li>\r</ul>\r\r', 22, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

Here are other tips for bathing.</p>\r\r<p>Safety tips:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Never leave a confused or frail person alone in the tub or shower.</li>\r<li>Always check the water temperature before he or she gets in the tub or shower.</li>\r<li>Use plastic containers for shampoo or soap to prevent them from breaking.</li>\r<li>Use a hand-held showerhead.</li>\r<li>Use a rubber bath mat and put safety bars in the tub.</li>\r<li>Use a sturdy shower chair in the tub or shower. This will support a person who is unsteady, and it could prevent falls. You can get shower chairs at drug stores and medical supply stores.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>Before a bath or shower:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Get the soap, washcloth, towels, and shampoo ready.</li>\r<li>Make sure the bathroom is warm and well lighted. Play soft music if it helps to relax the person.</li>\r<li>Be matter-of-fact about bathing. Say, "It\'s time for a bath now." Don\'t argue about the need for a bath or shower.</li>\r<li>Be gentle and respectful. Tell the person what you are going to do, step-by-step.</li>\r<li>Make sure the water temperature in the bath or shower is comfortable.</li>\r<li>Don\'t use bath oil. It can make the tub slippery and may cause urinary tract infections.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>During a bath or shower:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Allow the person with dementia to do as much as possible. This protects his or her dignity and helps the person feel more in control.</li>\r<li>Put a towel over the person\'s shoulders or lap. This helps him or her feel less exposed. Then use a sponge or washcloth to clean under the towel.</li>\r<li>Distract the person by talking about something else if he or she becomes upset.</li>\r<li>Give him or her a washcloth to hold. This makes it less likely that the person will try to hit you.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>After a bath or shower:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Prevent rashes or infections by patting the person\'s skin with a towel. Make sure the person is completely dry. Be sure to dry between folds of skin.</li>\r<li>If the person has trouble with incontinence, use a protective ointment, such as Vaseline®, around the rectum, vagina, or penis.</li>\r<li>If the person with AD has trouble getting in and out of the bathtub, do a sponge bath instead.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>Other bathing tips:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Give the person a full bath two or three times a week. For most people, a sponge bath to clean the face, hands, feet, underarms, and genital or "private" area is all you need to do every day.</li>\r<li>Washing the person\'s hair in the sink may be easier than doing it in the shower or bathtub. You can buy a hose attachment for the sink.</li>\r<li>Get professional help with bathing if it becomes too hard for you to do on your own.</li>\r</ul>', 31, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

Helping people with dementia brush their teeth, shave, or put on makeup, often means they can feel more like themselves. Here are some grooming tips.</p>\n\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:426}}</p>\n\n<p>Mouth care:</p>\r\r<p>Good mouth care helps prevent dental problems such as cavities and gum disease.</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Show the person how to brush his or her teeth. Go step-by-step. For example, pick up the toothpaste, take the top off, put the toothpaste on the toothbrush, and then brush. Remember to let the person do as much as possible.</li>\r<li>Brush your teeth at the same time.</li>\r<li>Help the person clean his or her dentures. Make sure he or she uses the denture cleaning material the right way.</li>\r<li>Ask the person to rinse his or her mouth with water after each meal and use mouthwash once a day.</li>\r<li>Try a long-handled, angled, or electric toothbrush, if you need to brush the person\'s teeth.</li>\r<li>Take the person to see a dentist. Some dentists specialize in treating people with dementia. Be sure to follow the dentist\'s advice about how often to make an appointment.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>Other grooming tips:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Encourage a woman to wear makeup if she has always used it. If needed, help her put on powder and lipstick. Don\'t use eye makeup.</li>\r<li>Encourage a man to shave, and help him as needed. Use an electric razor for safety.</li>\r<li>Take the person to the barber or beauty shop. Some barbers or hairstylists may come to your home.</li>\r<li>Keep the person\'s nails clean and trimmed.</li>\r</ul>\r<h2>Dressing</h2>\r\r<p>People with dementia often need more time to dress. It can be hard for them to choose their clothes. They might wear the wrong clothing for the season. They also might wear colors that don\'t go together or forget to put on a piece of clothing. Allow the person to dress on his or her own for as long as possible.</p>\r\r<p>Other tips include the following:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Lay out clothes in the order the person should put them on, such as underwear first, then pants, then a shirt, and then a sweater.</li>\r<li>Hand the person one thing at a time or give step-by-step dressing instructions.</li>\r<li>Put away some clothes in another room to reduce the number of choices. Keep only one or two outfits in the closet or dresser.</li>\r<li>Keep the closet locked if needed. This prevents some of the problems people may have while getting dressed.</li>\r<li>Buy three or four sets of the same clothes, if the person wants to wear the same clothing every day.</li>\r<li>Buy loose-fitting, comfortable clothing. Avoid girdles, control-top pantyhose, knee-high nylons, garters, high heels, tight socks, and bras for women. Sports bras are comfortable and provide good support. Short cotton socks and loose cotton underwear are best. Sweat pants and shorts with elastic waistbands are helpful.</li>\r<li>Use Velcro® tape or large zipper pulls for clothing, instead of shoelaces, buttons, or buckles. Try slip-on shoes that won\'t slide off or shoes with Velcro® straps.</li>\r</ul>', 32, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),

This research promises to improve the lives of people affected by the dementias and may eventually lead to ways of preventing or curing these disorders.</p>\r\r<h2>Causes and Prevention</h2>\r\r<p>Research on the causes of AD and other dementias includes studies of genetic factors, neurotransmitters, inflammation, factors that influence programmed cell death in the brain, and the roles of tau, beta amyloid, and the associated neurofibrillary tangles and plaques in AD. Some other researchers are trying to determine the possible roles of cholesterol metabolism, oxidative stress, and microglia in the development of AD. Scientists also are investigating the role of aging-related proteins such as the enzyme telomerase.</p>\r\r<p>Since many dementias and other neurodegenerative diseases have been linked to abnormal clumps of proteins in cells, researchers are trying to learn how these clumps develop, how they affect cells, and how the clumping can be prevented.</p>\n\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:427}}</p>\n\n<p>Some studies are examining whether changes in white matter may play a role in the onset of AD. Myelin may erode in AD patients before other changes occur. This may be due to a problem with oligodendrocytes, the cells that produce myelin.</p>\r\r<p>Researchers are searching for additional genes that may contribute to AD, and they have identified a number of gene regions that may be involved. Some researchers suggest that people will eventually be screened for a number of genes that contribute to AD and that they will be able to receive treatments that specifically address their individual genetic risks. However, such individualized screening and treatment is still years away.</p>\r\r<p>Insulin resistance is common in people with AD, but it is not clear whether the insulin resistance contributes to the development of the disease or if it is merely a side effect.</p>\r\r<p>Several studies have found a reduced risk of dementia in people who take cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. However, it is not yet clear if the apparent effect is due to the drugs or to other factors.</p>\r\r<p>Early studies of estrogen suggested that it might help prevent AD in older women. However, a clinical study of several thousand postmenopausal women aged 65 or older found that combination therapy with estrogen and progestin substantially increased the risk of AD. Estrogen alone also appeared to slightly increase the risk of dementia in this study.</p>\r\r<p>A 2003 study found that people with HIV-associated dementia have different levels of activity for more than 30 different proteins, compared to people who have HIV but no signs of dementia. The study suggests a possible way to screen HIV patients for the first signs of cognitive impairment, and it may lead to ways of intervening to prevent this form of dementia.</p>\r\n', 33, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(225, 'ds-g31.09-fl-hh_34', '<h2>Diagnosis</h2><p>Improving early diagnosis of AD and other types of dementia is important not only for patients and families, but also for researchers who seek to better understand the causes of dementing diseases and find ways to reverse or halt them at early stages. Improved diagnosis can also reduce the risk that people will receive inappropriate treatments.</p>\r\r<p>Some researchers are investigating whether three-dimensional computer models of PET and MRI images can identify brain changes typical of early AD, before any symptoms appear. This research may lead to ways of preventing the symptoms of the disease.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:428}}</p>\n\n<p>One study found that levels of beta amyloid and tau in spinal fluid can be used to diagnose AD with a sensitivity of 92 percent. If other studies confirm the validity of this test, it may allow doctors to identify people who are beginning to develop the disorder before they start to show symptoms. This would allow treatment at very early stages of the disorder, and may help in testing new treatments to prevent or delay symptoms of the disease. Other researchers have identified factors in the skin and blood of AD patients that are different from those in healthy people. They are trying to determine if these factors can be used to diagnose the disease.</p>\r\r<h2>Treatment</h2>\r\r<p>Researchers are continually working to develop new drugs for AD and other types of dementia. Many researchers believe a vaccine that reduces the number of amyloid plaques in the brain might ultimately prove to be the most effective treatment for AD. In 2001, researchers began one clinical trial of a vaccine called AN-1792. The study was halted after a number of people developed inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Despite these problems, one patient appeared to have reduced numbers of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other patients showed little or no cognitive decline during the course of the study, suggesting that the vaccine may slow or halt the disease. Researchers are now trying to find safer and more effective vaccines for AD.</p>\r\r<p>Researchers are also investigating possible methods of gene therapy for AD. In one case, researchers used cells genetically engineered to produce nerve growth factor and transplanted them into monkeys\' forebrains. The transplanted cells boosted the amount of nerve growth factors in the brain and seemed to prevent degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons in the animals. This suggests that gene therapy might help to reduce or delay symptoms of the disease. Researchers are now testing a similar therapy in a small number of patients. Other researchers have experimented with gene therapy that adds a gene called neprilysin in a mouse model that produces human beta amyloid. They found that increasing the level of neprilysin greatly reduced the amount of beta amyloid in the mice and halted the amyloid-related brain degeneration. They are now trying to determine whether neprilysin gene therapy can improve cognition in mice.</p>\r\r<p>A clinical trial called the <em>Vitamins to Slow Alzheimer\'s Disease</em> (VITAL) study is testing whether high doses of three common B vitamins, folic acid, B<sub>12</sub>, and B<sub>6</sub>, can reduce homocysteine levels and slow the rate of cognitive decline in AD.</p>\r\r<p>Since many studies have found evidence of brain inflammation in AD, some researchers have proposed that drugs that control inflammation, such as NSAIDs, might prevent the disease or slow its progression. Studies in mice have suggested that these drugs can limit production of amyloid plaques in the brain.  Early studies of these drugs in humans have shown promising results.  However, a large NIH-funded clinical trial of two NSAIDS (naproxen and celecoxib) to prevent AD was stopped in late 2004 because of an increase in stroke and heart attack in people taking naproxen, and an unrelated study that linked celecoxib to an increased risk of heart attack.</p>\r\r<p>Some studies have suggested that two drugs, pentoxifylline and propentofylline, may be useful in treating vascular dementia. Pentoxifylline improves blood flow, while propentofylline appears to interfere with some of the processes that cause cell death in the brain.</p>\r\r<p>One study is testing the safety and effectiveness of donepezil for treating mild dementia in patients with Parkinson\'s dementia, while another is investigating whether skin patches with the drug selegiline can improve mental function in patients with cognitive problems related to HIV.</p>\r\r<h1>Summary</h1>\r\r<p>This course should have provided you with a better understanding of dementia, their treatment options, and the latest research to find safer, more effective ways to diagnose and treat them.

The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluid infected with the Hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person who is not infected. Hepatitis B virus has long been recognized as an occupational risk for health-care personnel (HCP), including HCP trainees. The virus remains infectious for prolonged periods on environmental surfaces and is transmissible in the absence of visible blood. HCP do not recognize all exposures to potentially infectious blood or body fluids and, even if exposures are recognized, often do not seek post-exposure prophylactic management. In serologic studies conducted in the United States during the 1970s, HCP had a prevalence of HBV infection approximately 10 times greater than the general population. In 1983, an estimated 17,000 HBV infections occurred among HCP. Acute and chronic HBV infections are rare among HCP who respond to HBV vaccination, but HCP who do not respond to vaccination are thought to remain susceptible. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and was the first vaccine against a major human cancer. In studies of HCP who sustained injuries from needles contaminated with blood containing HBV, the risk for developing clinical hepatitis if the blood was both HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive was 22-31%; the risk for developing serologic evidence of HBV infection was 37-62%. By comparison, the risk for developing clinical hepatitis from a needle contaminated with HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative blood was 1-6%, and the risk for developing serologic evidence of HBV infection was 23-37%.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:431}}</p>\r\r<p>A national strategy to eliminate HBV transmission was implemented in 1991. A key component was a recommendation for routine vaccination of infants. As a result, the rate of newly reported acute HBV infections in the United States declined approximately 89% during 1990-2011, from 8.5 to 0.9 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence was lowest (0.04 cases per 100,000 population) among persons aged ≤19 years, the population routinely vaccinated as infants and adolescents. Although HBV vaccine coverage rates in 2011 were high among infants, children, and adolescents, self-reported ≥ 3-dose coverage remained considerably lower for adults aged 19-49 years.</p>\r\r<p>There were 2,895 cases of acute hepatitis B reported in 2012. After adjusting for asymptomatic infections and under-reporting, the estimated number of new HBV infections was 18,760. Acute hepatitis B has been declining in incidence since 1990 mainly due to effective vaccination strategies, but chronic HBV infection, estimated at 700,000-1.4 million of the US population (many of whom are unaware of their infection status), remains a major public health challenge.</p>\r\r<p>In contrast to a decline in reports of acute hepatitis B, the prevalence of chronic HBV, which is often asymptomatic, remained relatively stable at 3 per 100,000 persons.

Employee exposure to excessive noise depends upon a number of factors, including:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>The loudness of the noise as measured in decibels (dB).</li>\r<li>The duration of each employee’s exposure to the noise.</li>\r<li>Whether employees move between work areas with different noise levels.</li>\r<li>Whether noise is generated from one or multiple sources.</li>\r</ul></div>\r<p>Generally, the louder the noise, the shorter the exposure time before hearing protection is required. For instance, employees may be exposed to a noise level of 90 dB for 8 hours per day (unless they experience a Standard Threshold Shift) before hearing protection is required. On the other hand, if the noise level reaches 115 dB, hearing protection is required if the anticipated exposure exceeds 15 minutes.</p>\r\r<p>If engineering and work practice controls do not lower employee exposure to workplace noise to acceptable levels, employees must wear appropriate hearing protection. It is important to understand that hearing protectors only reduce the amount of noise that gets through to the ears. The amount of this reduction is referred to as attenuation, which differs according to the type of hearing protection used and how well it fits.</p>\r\r<p>Hearing protectors worn by employees must reduce an employee’s noise exposure to within the acceptable limits [Refer to <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9737" title="Click Here to View Appendix" target="_new">Appendix B of 29 CFR 1910.95</a>, Occupational Noise Exposure, for detailed information on methods to estimate the attenuation effectiveness of hearing protectors based on the device’s noise reduction rating (NRR)].

	(244, 'oc0510.1_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Respirators are devices that protect employees from inhaling harmful substances, including chemical, biological, and radiological agents. These substances can be in the form of airborne vapors, gases, dust, fogs, fumes, mists, smokes, or sprays. Some respirators also ensure that employees do not breathe air that contains dangerously low levels of oxygen or that is otherwise immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH), (e.g., life-threatening exposures during interior structural firefighting.) Respirators may be used to provide protection during routine operations where engineering controls and work practice controls are not able to provide sufficient protection from these hazards, or in emergencies.</p>\r\r<p>In situations in which employees are exposed to harmful airborne hazards, respirators must “seal off” and isolate the user’s respiratory system from the contaminated environment. The risk that a user will experience an adverse health outcome when relying on respiratory protection is a function of the toxicity or hazardous nature of the air contaminants present, the concentrations of the contaminants in the air, the duration of exposure, and the degree of isolation provided by the respirator. When respirators fail or do not provide the degree of protection expected by the user, the user is placed at an increased risk of any adverse health effects that are associated with exposure to the respiratory hazards present. Furthermore, the margin for error in IDLH atmospheres is slight or nonexistent because an equipment malfunction or employee mistake can, without warning, expose the employee to an atmosphere incapable of supporting human life. Such exposure may disable the employee and require an immediate rescue if the employee’s life is to be saved. Therefore, it is critical that respirators are properly selected and used in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134).</p>\r\r<p>Respirators provide protection from respiratory hazards only when they are properly selected and used in compliance with a Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 and 29 CFR 1926.103). The final Respiratory Protection standard applies to general industry, construction, longshoring, shipyard, and marine terminal workplaces.</p>\r\r<h1>Regulations</h1>\r\r<p>The Respiratory Protection standard requires employers to establish and maintain a written respiratory protection program to protect their respirator-wearing employees. OSHA revised the original 1971 Respiratory Protection standard in 1998. The new standard incorporates scientific principles and technologies that had emerged since 1971. Due to advances in technology, many areas covered by the previous standard had become outdated.</p>\r\r<p>The final revision of the Respiratory Protection standard is intended to:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Enhance the protection of employee health.\r<li>Promote more effective use of respirators.\r<li>Make it easier for you to comply with its provisions.\r<li>Make it easier to understand the policy and procedures you must follow when implementing a respiratory protection program.\r<li>Supersede most respiratory provisions in existing standard.\r</ul></div>\r<h2>The Respiratory Protection Program</h2>\r\r<p>A respiratory protection program is a cohesive collection of <i>written</i> worksite-specific procedures and policies that, utilized together, address all respiratory protection elements required by the standard. {{LOCATIONS:NAME}} policies/program must be evaluated for effectiveness on a regular basis.</p>\r\r<p>When respirators are used during operations where exposures exceed OSHA’s permissible exposure limit (PEL), use of properly functioning respirators is essential to ensure that employees are not placed at significant risk of material impairment of health. Respiratory protection is necessary in situations where engineering and administrative controls are insufficient to reduce airborne hazards, in emergencies, in situations in which engineering and other controls are being installed or maintained, in oxygen deficient atmospheres, or for internal structural firefighting.

As a result, some infectious diseases are now more difficult to treat than they were just a few decades ago.

There are several ways this happens.</p>\r\r<h3>Natural (Biological) Causes</h3>\r\r<p><b>Selective Pressure:</b> In the presence of an antimicrobial, microbes are either killed or, if they carry resistance genes, survive.

This information would be used by a healthcare provider to choose an appropriate antimicrobial treatment. However, current diagnostic tests often take a few days or weeks to give results. This is because many of today\'s tests require the microbe to grow over a period of time before it can be identified.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:308}}</p>\r\r<p>Oftentimes, healthcare providers need to make treatment decisions before the results are known. While waiting for test results, healthcare providers may prescribe a broad-spectrum antimicrobial when a more specific treatment might be better.

This bacterium is known as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, or MRSA (pronounced mersa). About one-third of people in the world have <i>S. aureus</i> bacteria on their bodies at any given time, primarily in the nose and on the skin. The bacteria can be present without causing an active infection. Of the people with <i>S. aureus</i> present, about 1 percent have MRSA, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:310}}</p> \r\r<p>MRSA can be categorized according to where the infection was acquired: hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) or community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA).</p>\r\r<h2>Hospital-Acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA)</h2>\r\r<p>HA-MRSA is acquired in the hospital setting and is one of many hospital-acquired infections exhibiting increased antimicrobial resistance. HA-MRSA has increased during the past decade due to a number of factors including an increased number of immunocompromised and elderly patients; an increase in the number of invasive procedures, e.g., advanced surgical operations and life support treatments; and failures in infection control measures such as hand washing prior to patient contact and removal of non-essential catheters.</p>\r\r<h2>Community-Associated MRSA (CA-MRSA)</h2>\r\r<p>CA-MRSA is caused by newly emerging strains unlike those responsible for HA-MRSA and can cause infections in otherwise healthy persons with no links to healthcare systems. CA-MRSA infections typically occur as skin or soft tissue infections, but can develop into more invasive, life-threatening infections. CA-MRSA is occurring with increasing frequency in the United States and around the world and tends to occur in conditions where people are in close physical contact, such as athletes involved in football and wrestling, soldiers kept in close quarters, inmates, childcare workers, and residents of long-term care facilities.</p>\r\r<p>MRSA has attracted the attention of the medical research community, illustrating the urgent need to develop better ways to diagnose and treat bacterial infections.</p>\r\r<h2>History</h2>\r\r<p>The <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bacterium, commonly known as staph, was discovered in the 1880s. During this era, <i>S. aureus</i> infection commonly caused painful skin and soft tissue conditions such as boils, scalded-skin syndrome, and impetigo. More serious forms of <i>S. aureus</i> infection can progress to bacterial pneumonia and bacteria in the bloodstream—both of which can be fatal. <i>S. aureus</i> acquired from improperly prepared or stored food can also cause a form of food poisoning.</p>\r\r<p>In the 1940s, medical treatment for <i>S. aureus</i> infections became routine and successful with the discovery and introduction of antibiotic medicine, such as penicillin. From that point on, however, use of antibiotics—including misuse and overuse—has aided natural bacterial evolution by helping the microbes become resistant to drugs designed to help fight these infections.</p>\r\r<p>In the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s, <i>S. aureus</i> developed resistance to penicillin. Methicillin, a form of penicillin, was introduced to counter the increasing problem of penicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i>. Methicillin was one of most common types of antibiotics used to treat <i>S. aureus</i> infections; but, in 1961, British scientists identified the first strains of <i>S. aureus</i> bacteria that resisted methicillin. This was the so-called birth of MRSA.</p>\r\r<p>The first reported human case of MRSA in the United States came in 1968. Subsequently, new strains of bacteria have developed that can now resist previously effective drugs, such as methicillin and most related antibiotics.</p>\r\r<p>MRSA is actually resistant to an entire class of penicillin-like antibiotics called beta-lactams. This class of antibiotics includes penicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, methicillin, and others.</p>\r\r<p><i>S. aureus</i> is evolving even more and has begun to show resistance to additional antibiotics. In 2002, physicians in the United States documented the first <i>S. aureus</i> strains resistant to the antibiotic, vancomycin, which had been one of a handful of antibiotics of last resort for use against <i>S. aureus</i>. Though it is feared that this could quickly become a major issue in antibiotic resistance, thus far, vancomycin-resistant strains are still rare.</p>', 5, 303, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(256, 'ma0500_06', '<h2>Transmission</h2><p>Today, <i>S. aureus</i> has evolved to the point where experts refer to MRSA in terms ranging from a considerable public health burden to a crisis. The bacteria have been classified into two categories based on where infection is first acquired.</p>\r\r<h3>Hospital-Acquired (HA)-MRSA</h3>\r\r<p>HA-MRSA has been recognized for decades and primarily affects people in healthcare settings, such as those who have had surgery or medical devices surgically implanted. This source of MRSA is typically problematic for the elderly, for people with weakened immune systems, and for patients undergoing kidney dialysis or using venous catheters or prosthetics.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:311}}</p> \r\r<p>A study published in 2005 found that nearly 1 percent of all hospital in-patient stays, or 292,045 per year, were associated with <i>S. aureus</i> infection. The study reviewed nearly 14 million patient discharge diagnoses from 2000 and 2001. Patients with diagnoses of <i>S. aureus</i> infection, when compared with those without the infection, had about three times the length of stay, three times the total cost, and five times the risk of in-hospital death. Notably, the <i>S. aureus</i> infections in this hospital study resulted in 14,000 deaths.</p>\r\r<h3>Community-Associated (CA)-MRSA</h3>\r\r<p>CA-MRSA has only been known since the 1990s. CA-MRSA is of great concern to public health professionals because of who it can affect. Unlike the hospital sources, which usually can be traced to a specific exposure, the origin of CA-MRSA infection can be elusive. CA-MRSA skin infections are known to spread in crowded settings; in situations where there is close skin-to-skin contact; when personal items such as towels, razors, and sporting equipment is shared; when personal hygiene is compromised; and when health care is limited.</p>\r\r<p>Outbreaks of CA-MRSA have involved bacterial strains with specific microbiologic and genetic differences from traditional HA-MRSA strains, and these differences suggest that community strains might spread more easily from person to person than HA-MRSA.</p> \n\n<div class="callout callout-blue”>\n	<h4>Note:</h4>\n                <p>While CA-MRSA is resistant to penicillin and methicillin, they can still be treated with other common-use antibiotics.</p></div>\n\nWhile CA-MRSA is resistant to penicillin and methicillin, they can still be treated with other common-use antibiotics.\r\r<p>CA-MRSA most often enters the body through a cut or scrape and appears in the form of a skin or soft tissue infection, such as a boil or abscess. The involved site is red, swollen, and painful and is often mistaken for a spider bite. Though rare, CA-MRSA can develop into more serious invasive infections, such as bloodstream infections or pneumonia, leading to a variety of other symptoms including shortness of breath, fever, chills, and death. CA-MRSA can be particularly dangerous in children because their immune systems are not fully developed.</p>\r\r<p>Everyone needs to pay attention to minor skin problems—pimples, insect bites, cuts, and scrapes—especially in children. If a wound appears to be infected, a healthcare provider and treatment should be sought.</p>\r\r<p>Researchers continue to study information about these cases in an attempt to determine why certain groups of people become ill when exposed to these strains. Researchers also continue to try to understand why high-incidence areas may appear. For example, for unknown reasons, severe outbreaks have occurred in Alaska, Georgia, and Louisiana.</p>\r\r<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\r\r<p>To diagnose <i>S. aureus</i>, a sample is obtained from the infection site and sent to a microbiology laboratory for testing. If <i>S. aureus</i> is found, the organism should be further tested to determine which antibiotic would be effective for treatment.</p>\r\r<p>Doctors often diagnose MRSA by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of drug-resistant bacteria. Current diagnostic procedures involve sending a sample to a lab where it is placed in a dish of nutrients that encourage bacterial growth (a culture). It takes about 48 hours for the bacteria to grow. However, newer tests that can detect staph DNA in a matter of hours are now becoming more widely available. This will help healthcare providers decide on the proper treatment regimen for a patient more quickly, after an official diagnosis has been made.</p>\r\r<p>In the hospital, a patient might be tested for MRSA if they show signs of infection, or if they are transferred to a hospital from another healthcare setting where MRSA is known to be present. A patient also might be tested if they have had a previous history of MRSA.</p>\r\r<h2>Treatment</h2>\r\r<p>Healthcare providers can treat many <i>S. aureus</i> skin infections by draining the abscess or boil and may not need to use antibiotics. Properly trained healthcare providers should only do draining of skin boils or abscesses.</p>\r\r<p>For mild to moderate skin infections, incision and drainage (I & D) by a healthcare provider is the first-line treatment. Before prescribing antibiotics, a medical provider will consider the potential for antibiotic resistance. Thus, if MRSA is suspected, the prescribing authority will avoid treating the patient with beta-lactam antibiotics, a class of antibiotic observed not to be effective in killing the staph bacteria. For severe infection, doctors will typically use vancomycin intravenously.</p>', 6, 151, 1, NULL, NULL),

Given the increasing prevalence of MRSA in both hospital and community settings, it is important to understand how MRSA spreads, the factors that influence the severity of disease (virulence factors), and how best to treat MRSA infections. Virulence factors can include proteins that allow the bacteria to adhere to and colonize the host, to invade host cells, to inhibit the host immune response, and to poison and damage host cells.</p>\r\r<p>Community-associated (CA) strains are notably effective at causing severe infections in otherwise healthy people and are different from the strains that cause hospital infections. As these strains begin to appear in hospitals where immunocompromised patients are at risk, it becomes increasingly important to understand how CA-MRSA can colonize and invade healthy people. Some current examples of NIAID-supported MRSA research are described below.</p>\r\r<h3>Virulence Associated Factors of CA-MRSA</h3>\r\r<p>Drs. Michael Otto and Frank DeLeo, and their colleagues at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories, recently described the essential role of the phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) protein family in CA-MRSA disease severity. These PSM proteins are able to destroy most immune cells, particularly white blood cells that help people fight off infection. While these proteins may not be the only virulence factors produced by CA-MRSA, they have been identified as major factors in the disease severity of CA-MRSA.</p>\r\r<h3>How CA-MRSA Spreads Among Households</h3>\r\r<p>Dr. Robert Daum, a researcher at the University of Chicago, is seeking to determine the best methods for containing, preventing, and treating CA-MRSA infections by understanding the circumstances that facilitate the transfer of CA-MRSA among household members. The study will determine how easily CA-MRSA is transferred from the initial infected person to other members within his/her household and at what rate household members become colonized or infected with CA-MRSA. The rate of CA-MRSA spread among household members will be compared to the rate of spread that occurs between a person infected with hospital-acquired (HA) MRSA, and other members within a household.</p>\r\r<h3>Strategies to Optimize the Use of Existing Antibiotics for MRSA Therapy</h3>\r\r<p>Two clinical trials are underway to define the optimal treatment for skin and soft tissue infections caused by CA-MRSA. CA-MRSA strains have remained more susceptible to commonly available antibiotics than HA-MRSA strains. \rTherefore, these trials will evaluate how effective off-patent antimicrobials are in treating uncomplicated cases of skin and soft tissue infections caused by CA-MRSA bacteria. Off-patent antimicrobials would be a cost-effective means of treating these infections and would alleviate the use of last-resort antibiotics such as vancomycin, which is essential for the treatment of HA-MRSA.</p>', 7, 335, 1, NULL, NULL),

Virtually the only people who develop illness from <i>Enterococcus</i> are those who are already ill, such as individuals in a hospital intensive-care unit or those who are elderly, have diabetes, have chronic kidney failure, and so forth.

	(259, 'ma0500_09', '<h2>Transmission</h2><p>VRE is transmitted from person-to-person most commonly by healthcare workers whose hands have inadvertently become contaminated, either from feces, urine, or blood of a person carrying the organism. It can also be spread indirectly via hand contact with open wounds or by touching contaminated environmental surfaces, where the bacterium can survive for weeks. VRE is <u>not</u> transmitted through the air. Of more than a dozen forms of enterococci bacteria, two are the primary concern for human disease: <i>E. faecium</i> and <i>E. faecalis</i>. <i>E. faecium</i> is the most frequent species of VRE found in hospitals.</p>\r\r<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\r\r<p>Enterococci have two types of resistance to vancomycin: acquired and intrinsic (natural). Some types of enterococci bacteria acquire the resistance when other bacteria come in contact with enterococci and share genetic information—scientists believe enterococci acquired the gene that resists vancomycin from bacteria in the digestive tract.

The healthcare team will want to know if the strain infecting the patient is resistant to vancomycin, and if so, is the resistance intrinsic or acquired? If the resistance is acquired, does the strain contain specific genes that can share resistance traits with other bacteria, thus making it able to spread disease? Tests are available to make those diagnoses.</p>\r\r<p>Some healthcare practitioners, as part of their normal infection control procedures, will test patients for the presence of VRE to learn whether they might be infected or colonized with the bacterium. This helps organizations know whether specific procedures should be used to reduce the potential spread of VRE.</p>\r\r<h2>Treatment</h2>\r\r<p>Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Some of the antibiotics that fail to work because of intrinsic resistance include some types of penicillin, cephalosporins, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides. Treatments that are ineffective because of acquired resistance include vancomycin, some penicillins, macrolides (such as erythromycin), tetracycline, quinolones, and others.</p>\r\r<p>The course of treatment is determined by testing different antibiotics in the laboratory to determine which ones might be most effective against the infectious strain.

NIAID is investigating several angles to learn why the bacteria that cause gonorrhea are becoming resistant to treatments, and studying new ways to treat and prevent the disease.</p>\r\r<h2>Gonorrhea</h2>\r\r<p>Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease caused by <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, a bacterium that can infect areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra, mouth, throat, eyes, and anus of both men and women. If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and increased risk of HIV infection. Gonorrhea can also be passed from mother to child and cause blindness or life-threatening infections in the infant.</p>\r\r<p>This bacterium is particularly good at picking up pieces of DNA from other bacteria, thereby altering its genetic makeup and sometimes resulting in new ways to evade antibiotics. By this process, different strains of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> have systematically become resistant to all but one class of antibiotics: cephalosporins. However, recent data suggest that even cephalosporins are becoming less effective against some strains found in the United States, Asia, and Europe (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm6026.pdf" title="Click Here to View this CDC Document" target="_new"><i>MMWR</i> 60[26]: 873-77, 2011; <i>Antimicrob Agents Chemother</i> 55[7]: 3538, 2011; <i>Euro Surveill</i> 15[47], 2010</a>). There is increasing concern that <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> may develop resistance to all available antibiotics, resulting in untreatable gonorrhea.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:316}}</p>\r\r<p>Facing the threat of untreatable gonorrhea, on August 9, 2012, the CDC published updated recommendations in the <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i> (MMWR), no longer recommending the oral antibiotic cefixime as a first-line treatment option for gonorrhea in the United States.</p>\r\r<p>This change reflects a shift to the last remaining drug proven effective for gonorrhea treatment, an injectable antibiotic known as ceftriaxone. The most effective treatment for gonorrhea is a combination therapy: ceftriaxone along with one of two other oral antibiotics, either azithromycin or doxycycline.</p>\r\r<p>In the past, gonorrhea has developed resistance to every antibiotic recommended for treatment, leaving the cephalosporins, which include cefixime and ceftriaxone, as a final recommended class of drugs. In light of this history and recent lab data, CDC researchers are concerned that continued use of cefixime may prompt gonorrhea to develop resistance to all cephalosporins. Limiting its use now may help preserve ceftriaxone as a treatment option for a little longer.</p>\r\r<h2>NIAID Research</h2>\r\r<p>NIAID funds laboratory research and clinical trials to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance. NIAID-funded research aims to develop better diagnostics, treatments, and new vaccines that are effective against emerging infectious agents, such as Multidrug-Resistant <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>.</p>\r\r<h3>Searching for Ways to Shut Down the Efflux Pump</h3>\r\r<p>NIAID-funded investigators are studying the molecular mechanics of how <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> bacteria are able to defend themselves against antibiotics. Dr. William Shafer at Emory University is studying the efflux pump, a structure that evolved in several types of bacteria to pump antimicrobial compounds out of the organism before they can do any harm. This work could help in the development of new types of therapeutics that inhibit the activity of the pump.</p>\r\r<h3>Zeroing in on Genes</h3>\r\r<p>In addition to studying structural characteristics, NIAID researchers are also interested in the genetics of the bacteria. Recently, the NIAID Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers worked with several investigators to sequence the genomes of several strains of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. This data will allow researchers to compare the genomes of resistant and sensitive strains and to possibly zero in on the genetic basis of resistance. A total of 14 genomes have been sequenced.</p>\r\r<h3>Evaluating New Treatment Options</h3>\r\r<p>Currently, the CDC recommends that most cases of gonorrhea in the United States be treated with a combination of two drugs: cephalosporins and a second antibiotic (i.e., azithromycin or doxycycline). At this time of rising antibiotic resistance, it is important that more than one type of treatment be available for infections like gonorrhea so that if an infection is resistant to one type of drug, there are other options. NIAID is studying new ways to treat cephalosporin-resistant infections by using existing antibiotic therapies in combination (i.e., gentamicin and azithromycin vs. gemifloxacin and azithromycin). Additionally, NIAID provides resources to eligible researchers to test novel and existing therapeutics in a mouse model of gonorrhea infection. Through this mechanism, scientists can obtain preliminary data on the ability of the product to prevent <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> infection.</p>\r\r<h3>Identifying Targets for Future Vaccines</h3>\r\r<p>A safe and effective vaccine for gonorrhea would help alleviate much of the urgent need for new and improved therapeutics. Dr. Cynthia Cornelissen, an NIAID-funded investigator at Virginia Commonwealth University, is working toward that goal. Currently, Dr. Cornelissen is studying two proteins as potential vaccine targets. These two proteins help the bacteria utilize iron and are expressed by all strains of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. After further analysis, if these two proteins are found to be essential for the survival of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, they may be identified as valuable vaccine targets. A vaccine that is designed to knock out these proteins and prevent the development of the bacteria would be a step forward for researchers in both the gonorrhea and antimicrobial resistance fields.</p>', 10, 386, 1, NULL, NULL),

Gram-positive bacteria retain a purple-colored stain, while Gram-negative bacteria appear pinkish or red.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:314}}</p>\r\r<p>Gram-negative bacteria can cause many types of infections and are spread to humans in a variety of ways. Several species, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, are common causes of foodborne disease. <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>—the bacteria responsible for cholera—is a waterborne pathogen. Gram-negative bacteria can also cause respiratory infections, such as certain types of pneumonia, and sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea. <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, the Gram-negative bacterium responsible for plague, is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected insect or handling an infected animal.</p>\r\r<h2>Increasing Concern About Drug Resistance</h2>\r\r<p>Certain types of Gram-negative bacteria have become increasingly resistant to available antibiotic drugs. Some strains are now resistant to many, most, or all available treatments resulting in increased illness and death from bacterial infections, and contributing to escalating healthcare costs. Examples of Gram-negative bacteria that have demonstrated drug resistance include:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li><i>E. coli</i>, which causes the majority of urinary tract infections.</li>\r<li><i>Acinetobacter baumanii</i>, which causes disease mainly in healthcare settings.

It is a common cause of pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis.</li>\r<li><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, which causes many types of healthcare-associated infections (HAI), including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.</li>\r<li><i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, which causes the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States.</li>\r</ul>\n</div>\r<h2>Transmission</h2>\r\r<p>Drug-resistant Gram-negative infections, such as <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter</i>, have emerged as major concerns in hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare settings. In some cases, bacteria can enter the body through urinary and intravenous catheters, ventilators, or wounds and can lead to pneumonia and infections of the bloodstream, bones, joints, and urinary tract. These types of infections disproportionately affect the very ill and the elderly and are often difficult to treat.</p>\r\r<h2>Prevention</h2>\r\r<p>Many Gram-negative bacterial infections occur through cross-contamination between people. Simple measures, such as hand washing and having healthcare workers wear gloves and gowns, can significantly reduce the spread of bacteria. Vaccines are <u>not</u> available for most healthcare-associated infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.</p>\r\r<h2>Treatment</h2>\r\r<p>Treating Gram-negative bacterial infections can be difficult because of several unique features of these bacteria. For example, the unique nature of their cell wall makes them resistant to several classes of antibiotics. Infections have typically been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as beta-lactams followed by carbapenems. However, even these drugs have become ineffective against some bacteria, leaving healthcare providers no choice but to use older drugs, such as colistin, which can have toxic side effects.</p>\r\r<h2>Research</h2>\r\r<p>New drugs to combat Gram-negative bacterial infections are needed. NIAID supports basic, translational, and clinical research into the development of new and effective drugs and other treatments.

They also need to know what protective measures are available to prevent adverse effects from occurring. OSHA designed the HCS to provide employees with the information they need to know.</p>\r\r<p>Knowledge acquired under the HCS will help employers provide safer workplaces for their employees. When employees have information about the chemicals being used, they can take steps to reduce exposures, substitute less hazardous materials, and establish proper work practices. These efforts will help prevent the occurrence of work-related illnesses and injuries caused by chemicals. The HCS addresses the issues of evaluating and communicating chemical hazard information to workers.</p>\r\r<h1>Hazard Communication Standard</h1>\r\r<p>The purpose of the HCS is to ensure that the hazards of all chemicals produced or imported are classified, and that information concerning the classified hazards is transmitted to employers and employees. The HCS is accomplished by means of container labeling and other forms of warning, safety data sheets and employee training. Under the provisions of the HCS, employers are responsible for informing employees of the hazards and the identities of workplace chemicals to which they are exposed.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:435}}</p>\r\r<p>OSHA estimates that over 5 million workplaces in the United States would be affected by the revised HCS. These are all those workplaces where employees—a total of approximately 43 million of them—could be exposed to hazardous chemicals. There are an estimated 650,000 existing chemical products, and hundreds of new ones being introduced annually. This poses a serious problem for exposed workers and their employers.</p>\r\r<p>Chemical exposure may cause or contribute to many serious health effects such as heart ailments, central nervous system, kidney and lung damage, sterility, cancer, burns, and rashes. Some chemicals may also be safety hazards and have the potential to cause fires and explosions and other serious accidents.</p>\r\r<p>Because of the seriousness of these safety and health problems, and because many employers and employees know little or nothing about them, OSHA issued the Hazard Communication Standard. The basic goal of the standard is to be sure employers and employees know about work hazards and how to protect themselves; this should help to reduce the incidence of chemical source illness and injuries.</p>\r\r<p>The Hazard Communication Standard establishes uniform requirements to make sure that the hazards of all chemicals imported into, produced, or used in U.S. workplaces are evaluated, and that this hazard information is transmitted to affected employers and exposed employees.</p>\r\r<p>Employers and employees covered by an OSHA-approved state safety and health plan should check with their state agency, which may be enforcing standards and other procedures "at least as effective as," but not always identical to, federal requirements.</p>\r\r<p>Basically, the hazard communication standard is different from other OSHA health rules because it covers all hazardous chemicals. The rule also incorporates a "downstream flow of information," which means that producers of chemicals have the primary responsibility for generating and disseminating information, whereas users of chemicals must obtain the information and transmit it to their own employees.

OSHA\'s Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is designed to ensure that information about these hazards and associated protective measures is disseminated. This is accomplished by requiring chemical manufacturers and importers to evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or import, and to provide information about them through labels on shipped containers and more detailed information sheets called safety data sheets (SDSs), formerly called material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The GHS Document (referred to as "The Purple Book") establishes agreed hazard classification and communication provisions with explanatory information on how to apply the system. The elements in the GHS supply a mechanism to meet the basic requirement of any hazard communication system, which is to decide if the chemical product produced and/or supplied is hazardous and to prepare a label and/or Safety Data Sheet as appropriate. Regulatory authorities (like OSHA) in countries adopting the GHS will thus take the agreed criteria and provisions, and implement them through their own regulatory process and procedures rather than simply incorporating the text of the GHS into their national requirements. The GHS Document thus provides countries with the regulatory building blocks to develop or modify existing national programs that address classification of hazards and transmittal of information about those hazards and associated protective measures. This helps to ensure the safe use of chemicals as they move through the product life cycle from "cradle to grave."</p>', 2, 235, 1, NULL, NULL),

The signal words used in this section are "danger" and "warning." "Danger" is used for the more severe hazards, while "warning" is used for the less severe. The signal word is used to indicate the relative level of severity of hazard and alert the reader to a potential hazard on the label. There are only two signal words, “Danger” and “Warning.” Within a specific hazard class, “Danger” is used for the more severe hazards and “Warning” is used for the less severe hazards. There will only be one signal word on the label no matter how many hazards a chemical may have. If one of the hazards warrants a “Danger” signal word and another warrants the signal word “Warning,” then only “Danger” should appear on the label.</p>\r\r<p><i>Hazard statement</i> means a statement assigned to a hazard class and category that describes the nature of the hazard(s) of a chemical, including, where appropriate, the degree of hazard. The hazard statement(s) describe the nature of the hazard(s) of a chemical, including, where appropriate, the degree of hazard. For example: “Causes damage to kidneys through prolonged or repeated exposure when absorbed through the skin.” All of the applicable hazard statements must appear on the label.

This statement is given with the condition for use "– text in square brackets may be used if additional information is provided with the chemical at the point of use that explains what type of ventilation would be adequate for safe use.” This means that, if additional information is provided with the chemical explaining what type of ventilation would be adequate for safe use, the text in square brackets should be used and the statement would read: "In case of inadequate ventilation wear respiratory protection." However, if the chemical is supplied without such ventilation information, the text in square brackets should not be used, and the precautionary statement should read: "Wear respiratory protection."</p>\r\r<p>Precautionary statements may be combined or consolidated to save label space and improve readability.

An order of precedence may be imposed by the chemical manufacturer, importer, or responsible party in situations where phrases concern "Response." Rapid action may be crucial. For example, if a chemical is carcinogenic and acutely toxic, rapid action may be crucial, and first aid measures for acute toxicity will take precedence over those for long-term effects.

	(277, 'as0005_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Most of us find it difficult to discuss death, whether it be our own, someone we know, or one of our patients. People that are dying are going through an experience that cannot be predicted, which can make it very difficult to handle for the dying person and all those around the dying person. By taking a closer look at the needs of dying patients, the range of emotions they may be going through, and the actual process of grieving for an individual that has died, we can not only understand within ourselves about death, but we can hopefully help the dying patient and those around the dying patient get through this highly emotional time.</p>\r\r<p>This course covers the unique needs of dying patients and the tasks employees of home healthcare organizations can do to help in their care and understand what the patient, family members, and caregivers may be going through. This course additionally covers the stages of grief that were established by Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and will assist employees in understanding the processes of grief with the intention of providing better, more compassionate care or services.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:455}}</p>\r\r<p>Losing someone (or something) you love is very painful. After a significant loss, individuals may experience all kinds of difficult and surprising emotions, such as shock, anger, and guilt. Sometimes it may feel like the sadness will never let up. While these feelings can be frightening and overwhelming, they are normal reactions to loss. Accepting them as part of the grieving process and allowing themselves to feel what they feel is necessary for healing.</p>\r\r<p>There is no right or wrong way to grieve—but there are healthy ways to cope with the pain. An individual can get through it! Grief that is expressed and experienced has a potential for healing that eventually can strengthen and enrich life.</p>\r\r{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\r\r<h1>End-of-Life Care</h1>\r\r<p>When a patient’s healthcare team determines that a disease can no longer be controlled, medical testing and curative treatment often stops. But the person’s care continues, with an emphasis on improving their quality of life and that of their loved ones, and making them comfortable for the following weeks or months.</p>\r\r<p>Medicines and treatments people receive at the end of life can control pain and other symptoms, such as constipation, nausea, and shortness of breath. Some people remain at home while receiving these treatments, whereas others enter a hospital or other facility. Either way, services are available to help patients and their families with the medical, psychological, social, and spiritual issues around dying. Hospice programs are the most comprehensive and coordinated providers of these services.</p>\r\r<p>The period at the end of life is different for each person. The signs and symptoms people have vary as their illness continues, and each person has unique needs for information and support. Questions and concerns that family members have about the end of life should be discussed with each other, as well as with the healthcare team, as they arise.</p>\r\r<p>Communication about end-of-life care and decision making during the final months of a person’s life are very important. Research has shown that if a person who has advanced disease discusses his or her options for care with a doctor early on, that person’s level of stress decreases and their ability to cope with illness increases. Studies also show that patients prefer an open and honest conversation with their doctor about choices for end-of-life care early in the course of their disease, and are more satisfied when they have this talk.</p>\r\r<p>Experts strongly encourage patients to complete advance directives, which are documents stating a person’s wishes for care. They also designate who the patient chooses as the decision-maker for their care when they are unable to decide. It’s important for people with terminal illnesses to have these decisions made before they become too sick to make them. However, if a person does become too sick before they have completed an advance directive, it’s helpful for family caregivers to know what type of care their loved one would want to receive. More information about advance directives can be found in course {{COURSE_NUMBER_TITLE:70}}.</p>', 1, 283, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(278, 'as0005_02', '<h2>Determining Life Span</h2><p>Patients and their family members often want to know how long a person who is terminal will continue to live. It’s normal to want to be prepared for the future. But predicting how long someone will continue to live is a hard question to answer. A number of factors, including the type of disease, its location, and whether the patient has other illnesses, can affect what will happen.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:456}}</p>\r\r<p>Although doctors may be able to estimate the amount of time someone will continue to live based on what they know about that person, they might be hesitant to do so. They may be concerned about over- or under-estimating the person’s remaining life span. They also might be fearful of giving false hope or destroying a person\'s will to live.</p>\r\r<h2>Requesting Professional Help</h2>\r\r<p>People caring for patients at home should ask them if they’re comfortable, if they feel any pain, and if they’re having any other physical problems.</p>\r\r<p>There may be times when a caregiver needs assistance from the patient\'s healthcare team. A caregiver should contact the patient\'s doctor or nurse for help in any of the following situations:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>The patient is in pain that is not relieved by the prescribed dose of pain medication.\r<li>The patient is experiencing onset of new symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, increasing confusion, anxiety or restlessness.\r<li>The patient is experiencing symptoms that were previously well controlled.</li>\r<li>The patient shows discomfort, such as grimacing or moaning.</li>\r<li>The patient is having trouble breathing and seems upset.</li>\r<li>The patient is unable to urinate or empty the bowels.</li>\r<li>The patient has fallen.</li>\r<li>The patient is very depressed or talking about committing suicide.</li>\r<li>The caregiver has difficulty giving medicines to the patient.</li>\r<li>The caregiver is overwhelmed by caring for the patient, is too sad, or is afraid to be with the patient.</li>\r<li>The caregiver doesn’t know how to handle a certain situation.</li>\r</ul></div>\r<p>Keep in mind that palliative care experts can be called upon by the patient’s physician at any point in the person’s illness to help with these issues. They are increasingly available not only in the hospital, but also in the outpatient setting.</p>\r\r<h2>Hospice Care</h2>\r\r<p>Many people believe that hospice care is only appropriate in the last days or weeks of life. Yet Medicare states that it can be used as much as 6 months before death is anticipated. And those who have lost loved ones say that they wish they had called in hospice care sooner.</p>\r\r<p>Research has shown that patients and families who use hospice services report a higher quality of life than those who don’t. Hospice care offers many helpful services, including medical care, counseling, and respite care. People usually qualify for hospice when their doctor signs a statement saying that patients with their type and stage of disease, on average, aren’t likely to survive beyond 6 months.</p>', 2, 182, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(279, 'as0005_03', '<h2>Caregivers Providing Emotional Support</h2><p>Everyone has different needs, but some worries are common to most dying patients. Two of these concerns are fear of abandonment and fear of being a burden. People who are dying also have concerns about loss of dignity and loss of control. Some ways caregivers can provide comfort to a person with these worries are listed below:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Keep the person company. Talk, watch movies, read, or just be with him or her.</li>\r<li>Allow the person to express fears and concerns about dying, such as leaving family and friends behind.

Keep objects that are meaningful to the person close at hand.</li>\r</ul></div>\r<h2>Caregiver Issues</h2>\r\r<p>It’s just as important for caregivers to take care of their own health during this time period. Family caregivers are affected by their loved one’s health more than they realize. Taking care of a sick person often causes physical and emotional fatigue, stress, depression, and anxiety. Because of this, it’s important for caregivers to take care of their own body, mind, and spirit. Helping themselves will give them more energy, help them cope with stress, and cause them to be better caregivers as a result.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:457}}</p>\r\r<p>It’s also helpful if caregivers ask for support from friends and family members.

Caregivers can ask them if they would like to sit in the room with them while they fall asleep.\r<li>Patients may sleep more and more as time passes. Caregivers should continue to talk to them, even if they’re unconscious, for the patient may still hear them.</ul></div>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n                <h4>Hard-to-control pain:</h4>\n                <p>It may become harder to control pain as the disease gets worse. It’s important to provide pain medication regularly. Caregivers should ask to see a palliative care doctor or a pain specialist for advice on the correct medicines and doses. It may be helpful to explore other pain control methods such as massage and relaxation techniques.</p></div>	\r<div class="callout callout-green">\n                <h4>Increasing weakness:</h4>\n                <ul><li>Weakness and fatigue will increase over time.

The loss of appetite is caused by the body’s need to conserve energy and its decreasing ability to use food and fluids properly.\r<li>Patients should be allowed to choose whether and when to eat or drink. Caregivers can offer small amounts of the foods the patient enjoys. Since chewing takes energy, they may prefer milkshakes, ice cream, or pudding. If the patient doesn’t have trouble with swallowing, offer sips of fluids and use a flexible straw if they can’t sit up. If a person can no longer swallow, offer ice chips.

But if the patient is agitated, they should not attempt to restrain them.  Caregivers should let the healthcare providers know if significant agitation occurs, as there are treatments available to help control or reverse it.\r<li>Sometimes patients report seeing or speaking with loved ones who have died. They may talk about going on a trip, seeing lights, butterflies, or other symbols of reality we can’t see. As long as these things aren’t disturbing to the patient, caregivers can ask them to say more. They can let them share their visions and dreams, not trying to talk them out of what they believe they see.</ul></div>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n                <h4>The dying process:</h4>\n                <ul><li>There may be a loss of bladder or bowel control due to the muscles relaxing in the pelvis. Caregivers should continue to provide clean, dry bedding and gentle personal care. They can place disposable pads on the bed under the patient and remove them when soiled. Also, due to a slowing of kidney function and/or decreased fluid intake, there may be a decrease in the amount of urine. It may be dark and smell strong.\r<li>Breathing patterns may become slower or faster, in cycles. The patient may not notice, but caregivers should let the doctor know if they are worried about the changes. There may be rattling or gurgling sounds that are caused by saliva and fluids collecting in the throat and upper airways. Although this can be very disturbing for caregivers, at this stage the patient is generally not experiencing any distress. Breathing may be easier if a person’s body is turned to the side and pillows are placed behind the back and beneath the head. Caregivers can also ask the healthcare team about using a humidifier or external source of oxygen to make it easier for the patient to breathe, if the patient is short of breath.\r<li>Skin may become bluish in color (cyanotic) and feel cool as blood flow slows down. This is not painful or uncomfortable for the patient. Caregivers should avoid warming the patient with electric blankets or heating pads, which can cause burns.

How people grieve depends on many factors, including their personality and coping style, their life experience, their faith, and the nature of the loss. The grieving process takes time. Healing happens gradually; it can’t be forced or hurried—and there is no “normal” timetable for grieving. Some people start to feel better in weeks or months.

This feeling is generally replaced with heightened awareness of situations and individuals that will be left behind after death.<br><br>\r<li><b>Anger:</b> "Why me? It\'s not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; <i>"Who is to blame?"</i><br><br>\rOnce in the second stage, the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue. Because of anger, the person is very difficult to care for due to misplaced feelings of rage and envy. Any individual that symbolizes life or energy is subject to projected resentment and jealousy.<br><br>\r<li><b>Bargaining:</b> "Just let me live to see my children graduate."; "I\'ll do anything for a few more years."; "I will give my life savings if..."<br><br>\rThe third stage involves the hope that the individual can somehow postpone or delay death. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made with a higher power in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. Psychologically, the individual is saying, "I understand I will die, but if I could just have more time..."<br><br>\r<li><b>Depression:</b> "I\'m so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I\'m going to die... What\'s the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?"<br><br>\rDuring the fourth stage, the dying person begins to understand the certainty of death. Because of this, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors, and spend much of the time crying and grieving. This process allows the dying person to disconnect oneself from things of love and affection. It is not recommended to attempt to cheer up an individual who is in this stage. It is an important time for grieving that must be processed.<br><br>\r<li><b>Acceptance:</b> "It\'s going to be okay."; "I can\'t fight it, I may as well prepare for it."<br><br>\rIn this last stage, the individual begins to come to terms with their mortality or that of their loved one.\r</ol></div>\r<p>Kübler-Ross originally applied these stages to people suffering from terminal illness, later to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). This may also include significant life events such as the death of a loved one, divorce, drug addiction, the onset of a disease or chronic illness, an infertility diagnosis, as well as many tragedies and disasters.</p>\r\r<p>Kübler-Ross claimed these steps do not necessarily come in the order noted above, nor are all steps experienced by all patients, though she stated a person will always experience at least two. Often, people will experience several stages in a "roller coaster" effect—switching between two or more stages, returning to one or more several times before working through it.</p>\r\r<p>Significantly, people experiencing the stages should not force the process. The grief process is highly personal and should not be rushed, nor lengthened, on the basis of an individual\'s imposed time frame or opinion. One should merely be aware that the stages will be worked through and the ultimate stage of "Acceptance" will be reached.</p>\r\r<p>However, there are individuals who struggle with death until the end. Some psychologists believe that the harder a person fights death, the more likely they are to stay in the denial stage. If this is the case, it is possible the ill person will have more difficulty dying in a dignified way. Other psychologists state that not confronting death until the end is adaptive for some people. Those who experience problems working through the stages should consider professional grief counseling or support groups.</p>', 6, 246, 1, NULL, NULL),

Just remember that almost anything that they experience in the early stages of grief is normal—including feeling like they’re going crazy, feeling like they’re in a bad dream, or questioning their religious beliefs.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<p><ul>\r<li><b>Shock and Disbelief:</b> Right after a loss, it can be hard to accept what happened. Individuals may feel numb, have trouble believing that the loss really happened, or even deny the truth. If someone they love has died, they may keep expecting them to show up, even though they know they’re gone.\r<li><b>Sadness:</b> Profound sadness is probably the most universally experienced symptom of grief. They may have feelings of emptiness, despair, yearning, or deep loneliness. They may also cry a lot or feel emotionally unstable.\r<li><b>Guilt:</b> They may regret or feel guilty about things they did or didn’t say or do. They may also feel guilty about certain feelings (e.g. feeling relieved when the person died after a long, difficult illness). After a death, they may even feel guilty for not doing something to prevent the death, even if there was nothing more they could have done.\r<li><b>Anger:</b> Even if the loss was nobody’s fault, they may feel angry and resentful. If they lost a loved one, they may be angry at themselves, God, the doctors, or even the person who died for abandoning them. They may feel the need to blame someone for the injustice that was done to them.\r<li><b>Fear:</b> A significant loss can trigger a host of worries and fears. They may feel anxious, helpless, or insecure. They may even have panic attacks. The death of a loved one can trigger fears about an individual’s own mortality, of facing life without that person, or the responsibilities they now face alone.\r<li><b>Physical Symptoms:</b> We often think of grief as a strictly emotional process, but grief often involves physical problems, including fatigue, nausea, lowered immunity, weight loss or weight gain, aches and pains, and insomnia.\r</ul></p></div>\r<h2>The Stages of Grief</h2>\r\r<p>The stages have evolved since their introduction and they have been very misunderstood over the past three decades. They were never meant to help tuck messy emotions into neat packages. They are responses to loss that many people have, but there is not a typical response to loss as there is no typical loss. Our grief is as individual as our lives.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:459}}</p>\r\r<p>The five stages, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are a part of the framework that makes up an individual’s learning to live with the one they lost. They are tools to help us frame and identify what our patients, family members, and even coworkers may be feeling. But they are not stops on some linear timeline in grief. Not everyone goes through all of them or in a prescribed order. Our hope is that with these stages comes the knowledge of grief ’s terrain, making us better equipped to cope with life and loss, and understand what the people we encounter everyday in our jobs are going through.</p>', 7, 197, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(284, 'as0005_08', '<h3>Denial</h3><p>This first stage of grieving helps individuals to survive the loss. In this stage, the world becomes meaningless and overwhelming. Life makes no sense. Individuals are in a state of shock and denial. They go numb. They wonder how they can go on, if they can go on, and why should they go on. Individuals try to find a way to simply get through each day. Denial and shock help them to cope and make survival possible. Denial helps them to pace their feelings of grief. There is a grace in denial. It is nature’s way of letting in only as much as we can handle. As individuals accept the reality of the loss and start to ask themselves questions, they are unknowingly beginning the healing process. They are becoming stronger, and the denial is beginning to fade. But as they proceed, all the feelings they were denying begin to surface.</p>\r\r<h3>Anger</h3>\r\r<p>Anger is a necessary stage of the healing process. Individuals must be willing to feel their anger, even though it may seem endless. The more they truly feel it, the more it will begin to dissipate and the more they will heal. There are many other emotions under the anger and they will get to them in time, but anger is the emotion individuals are most used to managing. The truth is that anger has no limits. It can extend not only to their friends, the doctors, their family, themselves, and their loved one who died, but also to God. You may ask, "Where is God in this?”</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:460}}</p>\r\r<p>Underneath anger is pain, their pain. It is natural to feel deserted and abandoned, but we live in a society that fears anger. Anger is strength and it can be an anchor, giving temporary structure to the nothingness of loss. At first grief feels like being lost at sea: no connection to anything. Then an individual gets angry at someone, maybe a person who didn’t attend the funeral, maybe a person who isn’t around, maybe a person who is different now that their loved one has died. Suddenly they have a structure—their anger toward them. The anger becomes a bridge over the open sea, a connection from them to others. It is something to hold onto; and a connection made from the strength of anger feels better than nothing. We usually know more about suppressing anger than feeling it. The anger is just another indication of the intensity of your love.</p>\r\r<h3>Bargaining</h3>\r\r<p>Before a loss, it seems like an individual will do anything if only their loved one would be spared. “Please God,” you bargain, “I will never be angry at my wife again if you’ll just let her live.” After a loss, bargaining may take the form of a temporary truce. “What if I devote the rest of my life to helping others? Then can I wake up and realize this has all been a bad dream?”</p>\r\r<p>Individuals become lost in a maze of “If only...” or “What if...” statements. Individuals want life returned to what is was; they want their loved one restored. They want to go back in time: find the tumor sooner, recognize the illness more quickly, stop the accident from happening...if only, if only, if only. Guilt is often bargaining’s companion. The “if onlys” cause individuals to find fault in themselves and what they “think” they could have done differently. They may even bargain with the pain. Individuals will do anything not to feel the pain of this loss. They remain in the past, trying to negotiate their way out of the hurt. People often think of the stages as lasting weeks or months. They forget that the stages are responses to feelings that can last for minutes or hours as they flip in and out of one and then another. Individuals do not enter and leave each individual stage in a linear fashion. They may feel one, then another, and back again to the first one.</p>', 8, 242, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(285, 'as0005_09', '<h3>Depression</h3><p>After bargaining, an individual’s attention moves squarely into the present. Empty feelings present themselves, and grief enters their lives on a deeper level, deeper than they ever imagined. This depressive stage feels as though it will last forever. It’s important to understand that this depression is not a sign of mental illness. It is the appropriate response to a great loss. Individuals withdraw from life, left in a fog of intense sadness, wondering, perhaps, if there is any point in going on alone? Why go on at all? Depression after a loss is too often seen as unnatural: a state to be fixed, something to snap out of. The first question to ask ourselves is whether or not the situation they’re in is actually depressing. The loss of a loved one is a very depressing situation, and depression is a normal and appropriate response. To not experience depression after a loved one dies would be unusual. When a loss fully settles in their soul, the realization that their loved one didn’t get better this time and is not coming back is understandably depressing. If grief is a process of healing, then depression is one of the many necessary steps along the way.</p>\r\r<h3>Acceptance</h3>\r\r<p>Acceptance is often confused with the notion of being “all right” or “OK” with what has happened. This is not the case. Most people don’t ever feel OK or all right about the loss of a loved one. This stage is about accepting the reality that a loved one is physically gone and recognizing that this new reality is the permanent reality. We will never like this reality or make it OK, but eventually they accept it. Individuals learn to live with it. It is the new norm that with which they must learn to live. They must try to live now in a world where their loved one is missing. In resisting this new norm, at first many people want to maintain life at it was before a love one died. In time, through bits and pieces of acceptance, however, they see that they cannot maintain the past intact. It has been forever changed and they must readjust. Individuals must learn to reorganize roles, reassign them to others, or take them on themselves.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:461}}</p>\r\r<p>Finding acceptance may be just having more good days than bad ones. As individuals begin to live again and enjoy their life, they often feel that in doing so, they are betraying their loved one. They can never replace what has been lost, but they can make new connections, new meaningful relationships, new inter-dependencies. Instead of denying their feelings, they listen to their needs; they move, they change, they grow, they evolve. Individuals may start to reach out to others and become involved in their lives. They invest in their friendships and in their relationship with themselves. They begin to live again, but they cannot do so until they have given grief its time.</p>', 9, 185, 1, NULL, NULL),

Even if individuals aren’t comfortable talking about their feelings under normal circumstances, it’s important to express them when they’re grieving.

In order to heal, they have to acknowledge the pain. Trying to avoid feelings of sadness and loss only prolongs the grieving process. Unresolved grief can also lead to complications such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and health problems.\r<li><b>Express Their Feelings in a Tangible or Creative Way.</b> They can write about their loss in a journal. If they’ve lost a loved one, they can write a letter saying the things they never got to say; make a scrapbook or photo album celebrating the person’s life; or get involved in a cause or organization that was important to him or her.\r<li><b>Look After Their Physical Health.</b> The mind and body are connected. When an individual feels good physically, they’ll also feel better emotionally. They can combat stress and fatigue by getting enough sleep, eating right, and exercising. They shouldn’t use alcohol or drugs to numb the pain of grief or lift their mood artificially.\r<li><b>Individuals Should Not Let Anyone Tell Them How to Feel, and They Shouldn’t Tell Themselves How to Feel Either.</b> An individual’s grief is his or her own, and no one else can tell them when it’s time to “move on” or “get over it.” Let them feel whatever they feel without embarrassment or judgment. It’s okay to be angry, to yell at the heavens, to cry or not to cry. It’s also okay to laugh, to find moments of joy, and to let go when they’re ready.\r<li><b>Plan Ahead for Grief “Triggers.”</b> Anniversaries, holidays, and milestones can reawaken memories and feelings. Be prepared for an emotional wallop, and know that it’s completely normal. If they’re sharing a holiday or lifecycle event with other relatives, recommend they talk to people ahead of time about their expectations and agree on strategies to honor the person they loved.\r</ul></p></div>\r<p>It’s normal to feel sad, numb, or angry following a loss.

Home healthcare is usually less expensive, more convenient, and just as effective as care received in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. In general, the goal of home healthcare is to provide treatment for an illness or injury. Home healthcare helps an individual get better, regain their independence, become as self-sufficient as possible, or allow them to determine their end-of-life choices by spending their remaining time at home with the ones they love.</p>\r\r<p>Home healthcare includes many facets of the healthcare system that come together to form a healthcare team. This course is intended to teach you about some of the common professions that comprise the home healthcare team.

Individuals can have private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or pay privately—all receiving the same level of care. In addition, the home healthcare team must function as a team. Having a multitude of businesses that provide fractured services serves little to no benefit for the home health patient. Every aspect of the home healthcare team must communicate with each other on a regular basis to ensure that the patient’s needs are being met. Individualized plans of care should be created and all of the home healthcare team should provide input on the plan. When many of the services being provided to a specific individual are provided by different organizations, sometimes policies and procedures can get in the way. It should be each organization’s goal and vision to communicate with the patient, the other members of the healthcare team, and the licensed prescribing authority, e.g., physician, nurse practitioner. The patient is the sole reason we are in our respective profession and we must treat each patient as an individual, which means we must understand each of the other providers of care and how to communicate with them.</p>\r\r<p>The remainder of this course will provide an overview of the main provider types that encompass the home healthcare team so that you can understand their roles and yours.</p>\r\r{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}', 1, 203, 1, NULL, NULL),

The care provided typically consists of licensed healthcare professionals, who may include nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. Additional services such as those of a medical social worker or home health aide may be provided. Physicians may refer patients for home healthcare services, or family members or patients may request the services.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:464}}</p>\r\r<p>Oftentimes patients who receive home health nursing services must be determined to be <i>homebound</i>.

Since the nurse is usually operating alone, they usually operate within a preset scope of care that is defined by their agency. A medical director or board of directors at each agency approves their scope of care. The amount of time a home healthcare nurse works directly with a physician is reduced compared to an inpatient nurse. In home care, the physician (or other licensed prescribing authority) relies on the assessments of the home health nurse. The home care nurse documents his/her assessments and treatments and communicates with the ordering physician and their central office.</p>\r\r<p>Home healthcare professionals recognize that the care setting—the home—is the sacred domain of the patient. Therefore, compared to inpatient care, often times the patient has a greater role in determining how, and even if, certain treatments or services will be implemented. In addition to the care provided directly from home healthcare nurses, patients are taught self-care, which may include teaching family members or other informal caregivers. Since this type of care happens without a licensed healthcare professional present, the professional clinician has no authority over these caregivers.</p>\r\r<p>Each professional caregiver must understand that each home they visit is a unique healthcare environment. The home health nurse must not judge the environment based on preconceived ideas of what is normal. What may be normal for the healthcare provider may not be for the patient in their home environment. Nurses and other professional healthcare staff must determine if there are any risks to the patient, and if they can be eliminated.</p>\r\r<p>The provision of home health nursing services is performed by home health agencies, which are very complex and sophisticated organizations that must manage many patients and all the different services they may be providing.

	(290, 'as0001_03', '<h2>Hospice Services</h2><p>Hospice care is a type and philosophy of end-of-life care that focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient\'s symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice as a place to treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century and came into the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. Since its first establishment, the industry has rapidly expanded. In the United States, it is distinguished by more extensive volunteerism and a greater emphasis on the patient\'s psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.</p>\r\r<p>With practices largely defined by the Medicare system, and other health insurance providers, hospice care is made available in the United States to patients of any age with any terminal prognosis who are medically certified to have less than six months to live. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States utilized hospice treatment. More than one-third of dying Americans utilize the service. However, common misperceptions regarding the length of time a patient may receive hospice care and the kinds of illnesses covered may result in hospice being underutilized.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:465}}</p>\r\r<p>Although most hospice patients are in treatment for less than thirty days, care may extend beyond six months so long as a patient\'s condition continues to merit such medical outlook. Medical and social services are supplied to patients and their families by an interdisciplinary team of professional providers and volunteers who take a patient-directed approach to managing illness. Generally, treatment is not diagnostic or curative, although the patient may choose some treatment options intended to prolong life, such as CPR. Medicare or other providers cover most hospice services, and many hospices can provide access to charitable resources for patients lacking such coverage.</p>\r\r<p>Care may be provided in a patient\'s home or in a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with different levels of care, which is based upon frequent evaluation of the patient\'s needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged for a number of reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change.</p>\r\r<p>Hospice care also involves assistance for patients’ families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home.</p>\r\r<p>The Visiting Nurses Association states: Hospice services focus on keeping an individual as comfortable and pain free as possible when curative measures are no longer effective. Hospice services also assist the patient and family members with respite care and bereavement care. Additionally, hospice care addresses the patient\'s emotional and spiritual needs as well as links to community resources. Most home health care agencies provide hospice services or can refer patients to a hospice in the patient’s area.</p>\r\r<p>Another term that is usually associated with the provision of hospice services is palliative care. Palliative care (from Latin <i>palliare</i>, to cloak) is an area of healthcare that focuses on relieving and preventing the suffering of patients.

It is often mistakenly assumed that drug abusers lack moral principles or willpower and that they could stop using drugs simply by choosing to change their behavior. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting takes more than good intentions or a strong will. In fact, because drugs change the brain in ways that foster compulsive drug abuse, quitting is difficult, even for those who are ready to do so. Through scientific advances, we know more about how drugs work in the brain than ever, and we also know that drug addiction can be successfully treated to help people stop abusing drugs and start leading productive lives.</p>\r\r<p>Drug abuse and addiction have negative economic consequences for individuals and for society. Estimates of the total overall costs of substance abuse in the United States, including productivity and health- and crime-related costs, exceed 600 billion dollars annually. This includes approximately 193 billion dollars for illicit drugs, 193 billion dollars for tobacco, and 235 billion dollars for alcohol. As staggering as these numbers are, they do not fully describe the breadth of destructive public health and safety implications of drug abuse and addiction, such as family disintegration, loss of employment, failure in school, domestic violence, and child abuse.</p>', 1, 258, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(299, 'oc0620.1_02', '<h3>Drug Addiction</h3>\r\r<p>Addiction is a chronic, often relapsing, brain disease that causes compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences to the addicted individual and to those around him or her. Although the initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, the brain changes that occur over time challenge an addicted person’s self control and hamper his or her ability to resist intense impulses to take drugs.</p>\r\r<p>Fortunately, treatments are available to help people counter addiction’s powerful disruptive effects. Research shows that combining addiction treatment medications with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for most patients. Treatment approaches that are tailored to each patient’s drug abuse patterns and any co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and social problems can lead to sustained recovery and a life without drug abuse.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:474}}</p>\r\r<p>Similar to other chronic, relapsing diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, drug addiction can be managed successfully. And as with other chronic diseases, it is not uncommon for a person to relapse and begin abusing drugs again. Relapse, however, does not signal treatment failure—rather, it indicates that treatment should be reinstated, adjusted, or that an alternative treatment is needed to help the individual regain control and recover.</p>\n\n<h3>Physiology</h3><p>Drugs contain chemicals that tap into the brain’s communication system and disrupt the way nerve cells normally send, receive, and process information. There are at least two ways that drugs cause this disruption: (1) by imitating the brain’s natural chemical messengers and (2) by overstimulating the “reward circuit” of the brain.</p>\r\r<p>Some drugs (e.g., marijuana and heroin) have a similar structure to chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, which are naturally produced by the brain. This similarity allows the drugs to “fool” the brain’s receptors and activate nerve cells to send abnormal messages.</p>\r\r<p>Other drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine, can cause the nerve cells to release abnormally large amounts of natural neurotransmitters (mainly dopamine) or to prevent the normal recycling of these brain chemicals, which is needed to shut off the signaling between neurons. The result is a brain awash in dopamine, a neurotransmitter present in brain regions that control movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. The overstimulation of this reward system, which normally responds to natural behaviors linked to survival (eating, spending time with loved ones, etc.), produces euphoric effects in response to psychoactive drugs. This reaction sets in motion a reinforcing pattern that “teaches” people to repeat the rewarding behavior of abusing drugs.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:475}}</p> \r\r<p>As a person continues to abuse drugs, the brain adapts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine by producing less dopamine or by reducing the number of dopamine receptors in the reward circuit. The result is a lessening of dopamine’s impact on the reward circuit, which reduces the abuser’s ability to enjoy not only the drugs but also other events in life that previously brought pleasure. This decrease compels the addicted person to keep abusing drugs in an attempt to bring the dopamine function back to normal, but now larger amounts of the drug are required to achieve the same dopamine high—an effect known as tolerance.</p>\r\r<p>Long-term abuse causes changes in other brain chemical systems and circuits as well. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that influences the reward circuit and the ability to learn. When the optimal concentration of glutamate is altered by drug abuse, the brain attempts to compensate, which can impair cognitive function. Brain imaging studies of drug-addicted individuals show changes in areas of the brain that are critical to judgment, decision making, learning and memory, and behavior control. Together, these changes can drive an abuser to seek out and take drugs compulsively despite adverse, even devastating consequences—that is the nature of addiction.</p>', 2, 255, 1, NULL, NULL),

Risk for addiction is influenced by a combination of factors that include individual biology, social environment, and age or stage of development. The more risk factors an individual has, the greater the chance that taking drugs can lead to addiction. For example:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<p><b>Biology:</b> The genes that people are born with—in combination with environmental influences—account for about half of their addiction vulnerability. Additionally, gender, ethnicity, and the presence of other mental disorders may influence risk for drug abuse and addiction.</p>\r\r<p><b>Environment:</b> A person’s environment includes many different influences, from family and friends to socioeconomic status and quality of life in general. Factors such as peer pressure, physical and sexual abuse, stress, and quality of parenting can greatly influence the occurrence of drug abuse and the escalation to addiction in a person’s life.</p>\r\r<p><b>Development:</b> Genetic and environmental factors interact with critical developmental stages in a person’s life to affect addiction vulnerability. Although taking drugs at any age can lead to addiction, the earlier that drug use begins, the more likely it will progress to more serious abuse, which poses a special challenge to adolescents. Because areas in their brains that govern decision making, judgment, and self-control are still developing, adolescents may be especially prone to risk-taking behaviors, including trying drugs of abuse.</p></div>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:476}}</p>\r\r<p>Physical dependence is not equivalent to dependence or addiction and may occur with the chronic use of any substance, legal or illegal, even when taken as prescribed. It occurs because the body naturally adapts to chronic exposure to a substance (e.g., caffeine or a prescription drug), and when that substance is taken away, symptoms can emerge while the body readjusts to the loss of the substance. Physical dependence can lead to craving for the drug to relieve the withdrawal symptoms. Drug dependence and addiction refer to drug or substance use disorders, which may include physical dependence, but must also meet additional criteria.</p>\r\r<h2>Prevention is the Key</h2>\r\r<p>Drug addiction is a preventable disease. Results from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded research have shown that prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media are effective in reducing drug abuse.

Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine by using ether, crack cocaine is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and then heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form of cocaine that can be smoked. The term "crack" refers to the crackling sound heard when the mixture is smoked (heated), presumably from the sodium bicarbonate.</p>\r\r<p>There is great risk whether cocaine is ingested or absorbed by inhalation (snorting), injection, or smoking. It appears that compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted.

It was tested on animals and humans, and found to be medically useful as an anesthetic for surgery. Parke Davis marketed it for a short amount of time as a surgical anesthetic for humans under the trade name Sernyl®, but it caused agitation, delusions, and terrifying hallucinations in patients after surgery. Because of these side effects, it was removed from the human market and sold to veterinarians for surgery on animals under the trade name Sernylan®. PCP became more and more known as a recreational drug, and legitimate veterinary supplies were increasingly diverted for illicit sale. The commercial product Sernylan® was withdrawn from the market in 1978. PCP is still made in clandestine laboratories and is sold on the street by such names as "angel dust," "ozone," "wack," and "rocket fuel." "Killer joints" and "crystal supergrass" are names that refer to PCP combined with marijuana. The variety of street names for PCP reflects its bizarre and volatile effects. PCP is a white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water or alcohol. It has a distinctive bitter chemical taste. PCP can be mixed easily with dyes and turns up on the illicit drug market in a variety of tablets, capsules, and colored powders. It is normally used in one of three ways: snorted, smoked, or eaten.

Respiration becomes shallow, and flushing and profuse sweating occurs. Generalized numbness of the extremities and muscular incoordination may also occur. Psychological effects include distinct changes in body awareness, similar to those associated with alcohol intoxication. At high doses, there is a drop in blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, flicking up and down of the eyes, drooling, loss of balance, and dizziness. High doses of PCP can also cause seizures, coma, and death (though death more often results from accidental injury or suicide during PCP intoxication). Psychological effects at high doses include illusions and hallucinations. PCP may have effects that mimic certain primary symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions, mental turmoil, and a sensation of distance from one\'s environment. Sometimes, speech is sparse and mangled. Other effects include inability to feel physical pain, anxiety, disorientation, fear, panic and paranoia, aggressive behavior and violence.</p>\r\r<h3>Long-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>People who use PCP for long periods of time report memory loss, speech difficulties, depression, and weight loss. When given psychomotor tests, PCP users tend to have lost their fine motor skills and short-term memory. Mood disorders have also been reported. PCP has sedative effects, and interactions with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and benzodiazepines can lead to coma or death.</p>\n\n<h3>Health Hazards</h3>\r\r<p>PCP is addicting; that is, its use often leads to psychological dependence, craving, and compulsive PCP-seeking behavior. It was first introduced as a street drug in the 1960s and quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. Many people, after using the drug once, will not knowingly use it again. Yet others use it consistently and regularly. Some persist in using PCP because of its addicting properties. Others cite feelings of strength, power, invulnerability, and a numbing effect on the mind as reasons for their continued PCP use.</p>\n\n<p>Many PCP users are brought to emergency rooms because of PCP\'s unpleasant psychological effects or because of overdoses.

Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is present in varying amounts in beers and wines, and in distilled liquors such as whiskey, gin, and rum. When a person consumes alcohol, the stomach and intestines rapidly absorb it. From there, alcohol travels in the blood throughout the entire body, affecting nearly every tissue. Moderate and high doses of alcohol depress the functions of the central nervous system, including the brain. The higher the alcohol level is in the blood, the greater the impairment.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:483}}</p>\r\r<p>As blood passes through the liver, enzymes break down alcohol into harmless byproducts, which are eliminated from the body six to eight hours later.

Consequently, alcohol remains in the body, producing intoxicating effects hours after the last drink was swallowed.</p>\r\r<p>Small amounts of alcohol may relieve tension or fatigue, increase appetite, or produce an anesthetic affect that numbs pain. Larger quantities inhibit or depress higher thought processes, bolstering self-confidence and reducing inhibition, anxiety, and guilt. As a person becomes intoxicated, painful or embarrassing situations appear less threatening and, as drinking progresses, speech may become loud and slurred. Impaired judgment may lead to incautious behavior, and physical reflexes and muscular coordination may become noticeably affected. If drinking continues, complete loss of physical control follows, ending in stupor, and possibly death.</p>\n\n<h3>Short-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>When a person drinks alcohol, the alcohol is absorbed by the stomach, enters the bloodstream, and travels to all of the tissues. The effects of alcohol are dependent on a variety of factors, including a person\'s size, weight, age, and sex, as well as the amount of food and alcohol consumed. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is one of the main reasons it is used in so many social situations. Other effects of moderate alcohol intake include dizziness and talkativeness; the immediate effects of a larger amount of alcohol include slurred speech, disturbed sleep, nausea, and vomiting. Alcohol, even at low doses, significantly impairs the judgment and coordination required to drive a vehicle safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol can also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including domestic violence and child abuse. Hangovers are another possible effect after large amounts of alcohol are consumed; a hangover consists of headache, nausea, thirst, dizziness, and fatigue.</p>\r\r<h3>Long-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>Prolonged, heavy use of alcohol can lead to addiction (alcoholism). Sudden cessation of long-term, extensive alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and liver. In addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome.

In the first stage of liver disease caused by alcohol, fat accumulates in the liver. This stage of the disease is known as “fatty liver.” Most people do not notice symptoms of fatty liver, although in some people the liver becomes enlarged and tender. Some people with fatty liver develop hepatitis, which inflames and kills liver cells. Hepatitis is marked by jaundice, which gives a yellowish tint to the eyes and skin. Others may develop cirrhosis, an irreversible condition in which normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. The scarring prevents blood from traveling freely through the liver, building blood pressure in the veins that run from the intestine to the liver. Consequently, the liver can no longer process toxins efficiently, causing poisons to build up in the blood. This buildup can be fatal.</p>\r\r<p>Heavy drinking also damages heart muscle. Nearly half of all cases of cardiomyopathy are caused by alcohol abuse. In this heart disease, the heart muscles, particularly the right and left ventricles, enlarge and become flabby, reducing the heart\'s blood-pumping efficiency. This inefficiency reduces the flow of blood through the kidneys, which normally filter excess salts and water out of the blood. Eventually the blood volume rises, causing a potentially fatal backup of fluid in the lungs.</p>\r\r<p>Alcoholics tend to have high blood levels of the hormone epinephrine and deficiencies of the mineral magnesium. This combination produces severe arrhythmias, or heartbeat irregularities, a common cause of sudden death in heavy drinkers. Chronic drinkers typically develop hypertension, a leading cause of stroke.</p>\r\r<p>In some cases, alcohol withdrawal may lead to delirium tremens (DTs), which produces increasing confusion, sleeplessness, depression, and terrifying hallucinations. As this delirium progresses, the hands develop a persistent and uncontrollable shaking that may extend to the head and body.</p>\r\r<p>Women who drink excessive amounts of alcohol while pregnant run a high risk of having a baby born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the leading known cause of birth defects.

Even before bacteria were discovered as a cause of disease, Snow was able to stop devastating outbreaks by observing and recording information about distribution of the disease.

One was in a remote location, therefore not used much. Many of the cholera cases were clustered around the Broad Street pump. When Snow checked with the families of the cholera victims, he confirmed that they all used the Broad Street pump.</p>\r\r<p>Snow showed that by studying the distribution of cases, a source of infection could be found that explained the pattern. He then took action to stop the epidemic by having the pump handle removed.</p>\r\r<p>Snow did more pioneering work during another cholera outbreak in 1854. This outbreak affected several areas of London that depended on water hauled in by wagon. Two companies, the Southwark and Vauxhall (S & V) Company and the Lambeth Company, did the hauling.

For example, a person infected with measles begins to shed the virus in nasal and throat secretions a day or two before any cold symptoms or rash are noticeable. Many other diseases also have an incubatory carrier phase. Most notably, HIV infection may be present for years before the person develops any symptoms.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:498}}</p>\r\r<p>People with <b>inapparent infections</b> never develop an illness, but are able to transmit their infection to others. With some diseases, inapparent infections are more common than acute clinical cases, e.g., for every 100 individuals infected with poliovirus, only one becomes paralyzed. Four others will have a mild illness with fever, malaise, headache, nausea and vomiting. Ninety-five will have no symptoms at all, although they pass the virus in their feces.</p>\r\r<p>Sometimes the likelihood of an <b>inapparent infection</b> depends on another epidemiologic factor, such as <b>age</b>. Hepatitis A is a good example of this. Over 50% of adults infected with this virus develop symptoms. However, among children under 5, there may be 10 inapparent infections for every child who develops jaundice. So children are very effective spreaders of the hepatitis A virus, which is passed in the feces regardless of the presence of symptoms.</p>\r\r<p>With some diseases, such as meningococcal meningitis, the number of <b>subclinical cases</b> may be quite high before a single clinical case appears. On some military bases where outbreaks have occurred, the carrier rate has been documented at 50% or more.</p>\r\r<p><b>Convalescent carriers</b> are people who continue to be infectious during and even after their recovery from illness. This happens with many diseases, e.g., salmonella patients make excrete the bacteria in feces for several weeks, and rarely, even for a year or more. This is most common in infants and young children. Treatment with inappropriate antibiotics may prolong the convalescent carrier phase.</p>\r\r<p><b>Chronic carriers</b> are people who continue to harbor infections for a year or longer after their recovery, e.g., the chronic carrier state is not uncommon following hepatitis B infection, whether or not the person became ill, and may be life-long. The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B depends on the person’s age at infection. About 90% of infants infected at birth become chronic carriers of the disease, compared with only 1-10% infected after age 5. That is why it is so important to give hepatitis B vaccines to newborns.</p>\r\r<p><b>Animal Reservoirs</b></p>\r\r<p>Animal reservoirs of infectious agents can be described in the same way as human reservoirs. They may be acute clinical cases or carriers. Depending on the disease, different carrier phases may be important in transmission.</p>\r\r<p>Dogs infected with rabies may shed the virus in their saliva 3-5 days prior to the onset of symptoms. This is the reason that when a dog bites someone, it must be held in isolation for 7-10 days. If the dog doesn\'t develop signs and symptoms of rabies within that time, it could not have been infectious at the time of the bite.</p>\r\r<p><b>Environmental Reservoirs</b></p>\r\r<p>Plants, soil, and water may serve as the reservoir of infection for a variety of diseases. Most fungal agents (mycoses) live and multiply in the soil. Examples include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>The fungal organism that causes histoplasmosis lives in soil with high organic content and undisturbed bird droppings.\r<li>The bacterial agents that cause tetanus, anthrax, and botulism are widely distributed in soil.\r<li>The bacterial agent of Legionnaire’s disease lives in water, including hot water heaters.\r</ul></div>', 8, 323, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(324, 'oc0140.2_09', '<h3>Portal of Exit</h3><p>The portal of exit is the route by which the disease agent may escape from the human or animal reservoir. While many disease agents have only one portal of exit, others may leave by various portals. The portals most commonly associated with human and animal diseases are:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Respiratory \r<li>Genitourinary\r<li>Alimentary\r<li>Skin\r<li>Transplacental\r</ul></div>\r<p><b>Respiratory</b></p>\r\r<p>This is the route of many disease agents that cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, influenza, and tuberculosis. It is also the route used by many childhood vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b and pneumococcal disease. The respiratory portal of exit is the most important and the most difficult to control.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:499}}</p>\r\r<p><b>Genitourinary</b></p>\r\r<p>This portal of exit is the route of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and HIV. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, and leptospirosis, a bacterial infection, are both spread through urine released into the environment.</p>\r\r<p><b>Alimentary</b></p>\r\r<p>The alimentary portal of exit may be the mouth, as in rabies and other diseases transmitted by bites. More commonly, the other end of the intestinal tract spreads disease agents. These are referred to as enteric diseases. In general, enteric diseases may be controlled through good hygiene, proper food preparation and sanitary sewage disposal. Examples include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ul>\r<li>Hepatitis A\r<li><i>Salmonella</i>, including typhoid\r<li><i>Shigella</i>\r<li>Cholera\r<li><i>Giardia</i>\r<li><i>Campylobacter</i>\r</ul></div>\r<p><b>Skin</b></p>\r\r<p>Skin may serve as a portal of exit through superficial lesions or through percutaneous penetration. Superficial skin lesions that produce infectious discharges are found in smallpox, varicella (chickenpox), syphilis, chancroid, and impetigo. Percutaneous exit occurs through mosquito bites (malaria, West Nile virus) or through the use of needles (hepatitis B, C & HIV).</p>\r\r<p><b>Transplacental</b></p>\r\r<p>This portal of exit from mother to fetus is important in the transmission of rubella, HIV, syphilis, and cytomegalovirus (the most common infectious cause of developmental disabilities). It is, fortunately, not a factor for most diseases.</p>', 9, 164, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(325, 'oc0140.2_10', '<h3>Mode of Transmission</h3><p>A mode of transmission is necessary to bridge the gap between the portal of exit from the reservoir and the portal of entry into the host. The two basic modes are direct and indirect.</p>\r\r<p><b>Direct Transmission</b></p>\r\r<p>Direct transmission occurs more or less immediately. Many diseases are transmitted by direct contact with the human, animal, or environmental reservoir. Prime examples are sexually transmitted diseases and enteric diseases such as <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, and <i>Campylobacter</i>. Contact with soil may lead to mycotic (fungal) diseases.</p>\r\r<p>Droplet spread is also considered direct transmission. Infectious aerosols produced by coughing or sneezing can transmit infection directly to susceptible people up to three feet away. Many respiratory diseases are spread this way.</p>\r\r<p><b>Indirect Transmission</b></p>\r\r<p>Animate mechanisms involve vectors. Flies may transmit infectious agents such as <i>Shigella</i> by walking on feces and then on food. Mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas may serve as reservoirs for the growth and multiplication of agents, for example in malaria or Lyme disease.</p>\r\r<p>Inanimate mechanisms spread disease through environmental vehicles or by air. Anything may be a vehicle, including objects, food, water, milk, or biological products.</p>\r\r<p><b>Indirect Airborne Transmission</b></p>\r\r<p>Indirect, airborne transmission is important in some respiratory diseases. This occurs when very tiny particles of respiratory material become suspended in the air (called aerosols). Such particles may remain suspended and stay infectious for varying periods of time. They are particularly dangerous because their size (1 to 5 microns) allows them to be drawn deep into the lungs and retained. Tuberculosis is spread this way, as is measles in certain settings such as doctors\' offices. Air may also spread particles of various sizes from contaminated soil, or from objects such as clothing and floors.</p>\r\r<h3>Portal of Entry</h3>\r\r<p>The portal of entry into the host is usually the same as the portal of exit from the reservoir. In some diseases, however, the exit and entry portals may differ. For example, staphylococcal bacteria may escape from one person’s respiratory tract to infect another person’s skin lesion. If that person is a food handler, the staphylococcal bacteria may escape from the infected skin lesion, contaminate food where it can incubate, and cause food poisoning in people eating the food.</p>\n\n<table align="center" border="1">\n	<thead>\n		<tr>\n			<th colspan="4" bgcolor="#0054a6" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n				<font color="#FFFFFF">Correspondence between Portal of Entry, Mode of Transmission, and Portal of Exit</font></th>\n		</tr>\n	</thead>\n	\n  	<thead>\n  		<tr>\n    			<th bgcolor="#66CCFF" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n				<font color="#FFFFFF">Portal of Entry</th>\n    			<th bgcolor="#66CCFF" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n				<font color="#FFFFFF">Mode of Transmission</th>\n    			<th bgcolor="#66CCFF" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n				<font color="#FFFFFF">Portal of Exit</th>\n    			<th bgcolor="#66CCFF" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n				<font color="#FFFFFF">Type of Disease</th>\n  		</tr>\n	</thead> \n<tbody> \n<tr>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Respiratory tract</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Airborne droplets, fomites</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Respiratory secretions</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Measles, common cold</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Alimentary tract</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Water, food, flies, fomites</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Feces</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Typhoid, polio, shigellosis</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Skin, genital membranes</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Direct contact, fomites, sexual intercourse</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Lesions, exudates</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Syphilis, gonorrhea</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Ocularmucous</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Fomites, flies</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Conjunctival exudate</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Trachoma</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">(Broken) skin</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Bloodsucking arthropod vector</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Blood</td>\n    <td style="padding:3px 10px;">Malaria, yellow fever</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\r', 10, 207, 1, NULL, NULL),

	(327, 'oc0140.2_12', '<h2>Infectious Disease Spectrum</h2><p>By now, you probably appreciate the complexity of the factors that work together to cause the transmission of infectious agents. The impact of disease agents on human host populations is also a bit complex.</p>\r\r<p>If a large number of individuals are equally exposed to an infectious agent, they do not all respond in the same manner. In fact, there may be a broad range of responses:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Some do not become infected at all\r<li>Some become infected, but develop no symptoms\r<li>Some become infected and develop mild or moderate symptoms\r<li>Some become infected and develop severe symptoms\r<li>Some die as a result of their infection\r</ul></div>\r<p>The following graphic illustrates this broad range of responses.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:501}}</p>\r\r<p>Part of this variation is due to the capacity of the agent to produce disease. Infection of a healthy adult population with Salmonella is likely to result in mostly inapparent or mild cases, with only a few people with more severe symptoms and very few deaths. On the other end of the spectrum, infections with rabies almost always result in severe illness and death.</p>\r\r<p>Part of the variation is due to differing levels of resistance of the hosts. If measles is introduced into a highly immunized population, then most individuals do not become infected. If measles is introduced into an unimmunized, nutritionally deprived population, the spectrum shifts toward severe symptoms and a high death rate.</p>\r\r<p>The existence of the infectious disease spectrum can make it challenging to find out the extent of transmission in a particular population. Most cases with inapparent or mild symptoms will never be discovered or reported, since these people will not seek health care. So when moderate or severe cases are reported, they may represent the "tip of the iceberg."</p>\r\r<p>Another challenge is posed by the fact that many diseases look alike. A variety of agents may produce essentially similar clinical syndromes. For example, the signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, other mycobacteria, and histoplasmosis may be the same. However, effective treatment and control measures are very different for these three diseases.

There are two tiers of HICPAC/CDC precautions to prevent transmission of infectious agents, Standard Precautions and Transmission-Based Precautions. Policies and procedures that explain how Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are applied, including systems used to identify and communicate information about patients with potentially transmissible infectious agents, are essential to ensure the success of these measures.</p>\r\r<h3>Standard Precautions</h3>\r\r<p>Standard Precautions are intended to be applied to the care of all patients in all healthcare settings, regardless of the suspected or confirmed presence of an infectious agent. Implementation of Standard Precautions constitutes the primary strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated transmission of infectious agents among patients and healthcare personnel.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:503}}</p>\r\r<p>Standard Precautions combine the major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation and are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include a group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. These include: hand hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g. wear gloves for direct contact, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient).</p>\r\r<p>The application of Standard Precautions during patient care is determined by the nature of the healthcare worker-patient interaction and the extent of anticipated blood, body fluid, or pathogen exposure. For some interactions, only gloves may be needed; during other interactions, use of gloves, gown, and face shield or mask and goggles is necessary.</p>\r\r<p>Standard Precautions are also intended to protect patients by ensuring that healthcare personnel do not carry infectious agents to patients on their hands or via equipment used during patient care.</p>\r\r<p>Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette, safe injection practices, and use of masks for insertion of catheters or injection of material into spinal or epidural spaces via lumbar puncture procedures have been added to Standard Precautions. While most elements of Standard Precautions evolved from Universal Precautions that were developed for protection of healthcare personnel, these new elements of Standard Precautions focus on protection of patients.</p>\r\r<p><b>Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette</b></p>\r\r<p>This precaution is targeted at patients and accompanying family members and friends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections, and applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering a healthcare facility. The term cough etiquette is derived from recommended source control measures for <i>M. tuberculosis</i>.</p>\r\r<p>The elements of Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ol>\r<li>Education of healthcare facility staff, patients, and visitors;\r<li>Posted signs, in language(s) appropriate to the population served, with instructions to patients and accompanying family members or friends; \r<li>Source control measures (e.g., covering the mouth/nose with a tissue when coughing and prompt disposal of used tissues, using surgical masks on the coughing person when tolerated and appropriate);\r<li>Hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions; and \r<li>Spatial separation, ideally >3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible.\r</ol></div>\r<p>Covering sneezes and coughs and placing masks on coughing patients are proven means of source containment that prevent infected persons from dispersing respiratory secretions into the air.</p>\r\r<p>Healthcare personnel are advised to observe Droplet Precautions (i.e., wear a mask) and hand hygiene when examining and caring for patients with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection. Healthcare personnel who have a respiratory infection are advised to avoid direct patient contact, especially with high-risk patients. If this is not possible, then a mask should be worn while providing patient care.</p>\r\r<p><b>Safe Injection Practices</b></p>\r\r<p>The investigation of four large outbreaks of HBV and HCV among patients in ambulatory care facilities in the United States identified a need to define and reinforce safe injection practices. The primary breaches in infection control practice that contributed to these outbreaks were:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>Reinsertion of used needles into a multiple-dose vial or solution container (e.g., saline bag)\r<li>Use of a single needle/syringe to administer intravenous medication to multiple patients\r</ol></div>\r<p>These and other outbreaks of viral hepatitis could have been prevented by adherence to basic principles of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications. These include the use of a sterile, single-use, disposable needle and syringe for each injection given and prevention of contamination of injection equipment and medication. Whenever possible, use of single-dose vials is preferred over multiple-dose vials, especially when medications will be administered to multiple patients.</p>\r\r<p>Outbreaks related to unsafe injection practices indicate that some healthcare personnel are unaware of, do not understand, or do not adhere to basic principles of infection control and aseptic technique. To ensure that all healthcare workers understand and adhere to recommended practices, principles of infection control and aseptic technique need to be reinforced in training programs and incorporated into institutional policies that are monitored for adherence.</p>\r\r<p><b>Special Lumbar Puncture Procedures</b></p>\r\r<p>In 2004, the CDC investigated eight cases of post-myelography meningitis that either were reported to the CDC or identified through a survey of the Emerging Infections Network of the Infectious Disease Society of America. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of all eight cases yielded streptococcal species consistent with oropharyngeal flora and there were changes in the CSF and clinical status indicative of bacterial meningitis. Equipment and products used during these procedures (e.g., contrast media) were excluded as probable sources of contamination. Procedural details available for seven cases determined that antiseptic skin preparations and sterile gloves had been used. However, none of the clinicians wore a facemask, giving rise to the speculation that droplet transmission of oropharyngeal flora was the most likely explanation for these infections. In October 2005, the HICPAC reviewed the evidence and concluded that there is sufficient experience to warrant the additional protection of a facemask for the individual placing a catheter or injecting material into the spinal or epidural space.</p>', 15, 510, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(331, 'oc0140.2_16', '<h3>Transmission-Based Precautions</h3><p>Transmission-Based Precautions are for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infectious agents, including certain epidemiologically important pathogens, which require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission. Since the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a healthcare facility, Transmission-Based Precautions are used empirically, according to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time, and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible infectious etiology is ruled out.</p>\r\r<p>There are three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions: Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Airborne Precautions. Transmission-Based Precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission is (are) not completely interrupted using Standard Precautions alone. For some diseases that have multiple routes of transmission (e.g., SARS), more than one Transmission-Based Precautions category may be used. When used either singly or in combination, they are always used in addition to Standard Precautions.</p>\r\r<p><b>Contact Precautions</b></p>\r\r<p>Contact Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important microorganisms, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient’s environment. Contact\rPrecautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:504}}</p>\r\r<p>A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options. In multi-patient rooms, >3 feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients.</p>\r\r<p>Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Contact Precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient’s environment. Donning PPE upon room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (e.g., VRE, <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens; RSV).</p>\r\r<p><b>Droplet Precautions</b></p>\r\r<p>Droplet Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:505}}</p>\r\r<p>A single patient room is preferred for patients who require Droplet Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options. Spatial separation of >3 feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patients; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on Droplet Precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.</p>\r\r<p><b>Airborne Precautions</b></p>\r\r<p>Airborne Precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus, varicella virus, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and possibly SARS-CoV). The preferred placement for patients who require Airborne Precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:506}}</p>\r\r<p>A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit-testing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate.</p>\r\r<p>Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Airborne Precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations, which are donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune healthcare workers should <u>not</u> care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox).</p>', 16, 348, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(332, 'oc0140.2_17', '<h3>Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions</h3><p>Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect for limited periods of time (i.e., while the risk for transmission of the infectious agent persists or for the duration of the illness). For most infectious diseases, this duration reflects known patterns of persistence and shedding of infectious agents associated with the natural history of the infectious process and its treatment. For some diseases (e.g., pharyngeal or cutaneous diphtheria, RSV), Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases, (e.g., <i>M. tuberculosis</i>) state laws and regulations, and healthcare facility policies, may dictate the duration of precautions. In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks.</p>\r\r<h3>Engineering Controls</h3>\r\r<p>Engineering Controls means controls (e.g., sharps disposal containers, self-sheathing needles, safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems) that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:507}}</p>\r\r<p>Examples of engineering controls used at {{LOCATION:NAME}} include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Providing handwashing facilities that are readily accessible to employees; when provision of handwashing facilities is not feasible, {{LOCATION:NAME}} will provide either an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes.

It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis B is usually spread when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the hepatitis B virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact with an infected person or sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment. Hepatitis B can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby at birth.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:540}}</p>\r\r<p>Hepatitis B can be either acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis B virus. Acute infection can—but does not always—lead to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person’s body. Chronic hepatitis B is a serious disease that can result in long-term health problems, and even death. The best way to prevent hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated.</p>\r\r<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines (in the Bloodborne Pathogens standard, 29 CFR 1910.103) hepatitis B virus as a pathogenic microorganism that can cause potentially life-threatening disease in humans. HBV infection is transmitted through exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials (OPIM).</p>\r\r<p>“Hepatitis” means inflammation of the liver. Toxins, certain drugs, some diseases, heavy alcohol use, and bacterial and viral infections can all cause hepatitis.

	(357, 'ms0134_02', '<h2>Differences Between Types</h2><p>Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are diseases caused by three different viruses. Although each can cause similar symptoms, they have different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently. Hepatitis A appears only as an acute or newly occurring infection and does not become chronic. People with hepatitis A usually improve without treatment. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also begin as acute infections, but in some people, the virus remains in the body, resulting in chronic disease and long-term liver problems. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B; however, there is not one for hepatitis C.

Symptoms usually last a few weeks, but some people can be ill for as long as 6 months.  Many people with hepatitis B have no symptoms, but these people can still spread the virus.</p>\r\r<h2>Chronic Hepatitis B Symptoms</h2>\r\r<p>Some people have ongoing symptoms similar to acute hepatitis B, but most individuals with chronic hepatitis B remain symptom free for as long as 20 or 30 years. About 15-25% of people with chronic hepatitis B develop serious liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. Even as the liver becomes diseased, some people still do not have symptoms, although certain blood tests for liver function might begin to show some abnormalities.</p>\r\r<p>If you think you may have or have been exposed to hepatitis B, talk to your health professional immediately.

Once a worker becomes allergic to latex, special precautions are needed to prevent exposures. Certain medications may reduce the allergy symptoms; but complete latex avoidance, though quite difficult, is the most effective approach.</p>\r\r<h2>Other Types of Reactions</h2>\r\r<p>The most common reaction to latex products is irritant contact dermatitis—the development of dry, itchy, irritated areas on the skin, usually the hands. This reaction is caused by irritation from wearing gloves and by exposure to the powders added to them. Irritant contact dermatitis is not a true allergy. Allergic contact dermatitis (sometimes called chemical sensitivity dermatitis) results from the chemicals added to latex during harvesting, processing, or manufacturing. These chemicals can cause a skin rash similar to that of poison ivy.</p>', 5, 149, 1, NULL, NULL),

Motor carriers operating in interstate commerce must comply with the new requirements beginning January 1, 2004. The new rules are based on the North American Cargo Securement Standard Model Regulations; the motor carrier industry\'s best practices. The new rules require motor carriers to change the way they use cargo securement devices to prevent articles from shifting on or within, or falling from commercial motor vehicles. The changes may require motor carriers to increase the number of tiedowns used to secure certain types of cargo. However, the rule generally does not prohibit the use of tiedowns or cargo securement devices currently in use.

	(408, 'di0033_06', '<h1>Weight and Balance</h1><p>You are responsible for not being overloaded. The following are some definitions of weight you should know.</p>\r\r<h2>Definitions You Should Know</h2>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li><b>Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW):</b> The total weight of a single vehicle plus its load.\r<li><b>Gross Combination Weight (GCW):</b> The total weight of a powered unit, plus trailer(s), plus the cargo.\r<li><b>Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR):</b> The maximum GVW specified by the manufacturer for a single vehicle plus its load.\r<li><b>Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR):</b> The maximum GCW specified by the manufacturer for a specific combination of vehicles plus its load.\r<li><b>Axle Weight:</b> The weight transmitted to the ground by one axle or one set of axles.\r<li><b>Tire Load:</b> The maximum safe weight a tire can carry at a specified pressure. This rating is stated on the side of each tire.\r<li><b>Suspension Systems:</b> Suspension systems have a manufacturer\'s weight capacity rating.\r<li><b>Coupling Device Capacity:</b> Coupling devices are rated for the maximum weight they can pull and/or carry.\r</ul></div>\r<h2>Legal Weight Limits</h2>\r\r<p>You must keep weights within legal limits. States have maximums for GVWs, GCWs, and axle weights. Often, maximum axle weights are set by a bridge formula. A bridge formula permits less maximum axle weight for axles that are closer together. This is to prevent overloading bridges and roadways.</p>\r\r<p>Overloading can have bad effects on steering, braking, and speed control. Overloaded trucks have to go very slowly on upgrades. Worse, they may gain too much speed on downgrades. Stopping distance increases. Brakes can fail when forced to work too hard.</p>\r\r<p>During bad weather or in mountains, it may not be safe to operate at legal maximum weights. Take this into account before driving.</p>\r\r<h2>Don\'t Be Top-Heavy</h2>\r\r<p>The height of the vehicle\'s center of gravity is very important for safe handling. A high center of gravity (cargo piled up high or heavy cargo on top) means you are more likely to tip over. It is most dangerous in curves, or if you have to swerve to avoid a hazard. It is very important to distribute the cargo so it is as low as possible. Put the heaviest parts of the cargo under the lightest parts.</p>\r \r<h2>Balance the Weight</h2>\r\r<p>Poor weight balance can make vehicle handling unsafe. Too much weight on the steering axle can cause hard steering. It can damage the steering axle and tires. Under-loaded front axles (caused by shifting weight too far to the rear) can make the steering axle weight too light to steer safely. Too little weight on the driving axles can cause poor traction. The drive wheels may spin easily.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:612}}</p>\n\n<p>During bad weather, the truck may not be able to keep going. Weight that is loaded so there is a high center of gravity causes greater chance of rollover. On flat bed vehicles, there is also a greater chance that the load will shift to the side or fall off.</p>', 6, 200, 1, NULL, NULL),

In closed vans, tiedowns can also be important to prevent cargo shifting that may affect the handling of the vehicle. Tiedowns must be of the proper type and proper strength. Federal regulations require the aggregate working load limit of any securement system used to secure an article or group of articles against movement must be at least one-half times the weight of the article or group of articles.

You may hit someone behind you. If you have a manual transmission vehicle, partly engage the clutch before you take your right foot off the brake. Put on the parking brake whenever necessary to keep from rolling back. Release the parking brake only when you have applied enough engine power to keep from rolling back.</p> \r\r<p>Speed up smoothly and gradually so the vehicle does not jerk. Rough acceleration can cause mechanical damage. When pulling a trailer, rough acceleration can damage the coupling.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:625}}</p>\r\r<p>Speed up very gradually when traction is poor, as in rain or snow. If you use too much power, the drive wheels may spin. You could lose control. If the drive wheels begin to spin, take your foot off the accelerator.</p>\r\r<h2>Steering</h2>\r\r<p>Hold the steering wheel firmly with both hands. Your hands should be on opposite sides of the wheel. If you hit a curb or a pothole (chuckhole), the wheel could pull away from your hands unless you have a firm hold.</p>\r\r<h2>Stopping</h2>\r\r<p>Push the brake pedal down gradually. The amount of brake pressure you need to stop the vehicle will depend on the speed of the vehicle and how quickly you need to stop. Control the pressure so the vehicle comes to a smooth, safe stop. If you have a manual transmission, push the clutch in when the engine is close to idle.</p>\r\r<h2>Backing Safely</h2>\r\r<p>Because you cannot see everything behind your vehicle, backing is always dangerous. Avoid backing whenever you can. When you park, try to park so you will be able to pull forward when you leave. When you have to back up, here are a few simple safety rules:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Start in the proper position.\r<li>Look at your path.\r<li>Use mirrors on both sides.\r<li>Back up slowly.\r<li>Back up and turn toward the driver\'s side whenever possible.\r<li>Use a helper whenever possible.\r</ul></div>\r<p>These rules are discussed below.</p>\r\r<h3>Start in the Proper Position</h3>\r\r<p>Put the vehicle in the best position to allow you to back safely. This position will depend on the type of backing up to be done.</p>\r\r<h3>Look at Your Path</h3>\r\r<p>Look at your line of travel before you begin. Get out and walk around the vehicle. Check your clearance to the sides and overhead, in and near the path your vehicle will take.</p>\r\r<h3>Use Mirrors on Both Sides</h3>\r\r<p>Check the outside mirrors on both sides frequently. Get out of the vehicle and check your path if you are unsure.</p>\r\r<h3>Back Up Slowly</h3>\r\r<p>Always back up as slowly as possible. Use the lowest reverse gear. That way you can more easily correct any steering errors. You also can stop quickly if necessary.</p>\r\r<h3>Back Up and Turn Toward the Driver\'s Side</h3>\r\r<p>Back up to the driver\'s side so you can see better. Backing up toward the right side is very dangerous because you can\'t see as well. If you back up and turn toward the driver\'s side, you can watch the rear of your vehicle by looking out the side window. Use driver-side backing—even if it means going around the block to put your vehicle in this position; the added safety is worth it.</p>\r\r<h3>Use a Helper</h3>\r\r<p>Use a helper when you can. There are blind spots you can\'t see. That\'s why a helper is important. The helper should stand near the back of your vehicle where you can see the helper. Before you begin backing up, work out a set of hand signals that you both understand; agree on a signal for "stop."</p>', 1, 307, 1, NULL, NULL),

This is the basic method:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Release accelerator, push in clutch and shift to neutral at the same time.\r<li>Release clutch.\r<li>Let engine and gears slow down to the rpm required for the next gear (this takes practice).\r<li>Push in clutch and shift to the higher gear at the same time.\r<li>Release clutch and press accelerator at the same time.\r</ul></div>\r<p>Shifting gears using double clutching requires practice. If you remain too long in neutral, you may have difficulty putting the vehicle into the next gear. If so, don\'t try to force it. Return to neutral, release clutch, increase engine speed to match road speed, and try again.</p>\r\r<h4>Knowing When to Shift Up</h4>\r\r<p>There are two ways of knowing when to shift:</p>\r\r<p><b>Use Engine Speed</b> (rpm): Study the driver\'s manual for your vehicle and learn the operating rpm range. Watch your tachometer, and shift up when your engine reaches the top of the range. (Some newer vehicles use "progressive" shifting: the rpm at which you shift becomes higher as you move up in the gears. Find out what\'s right for the vehicle you will operate.)</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:626}}</p>\r\r<p><b>Use Road Speed</b> (mph): Learn what speeds each gear is good for. Then, by using the speedometer, you\'ll know when to shift up.</p>\r\r<p>With either method, you may learn to use engine sounds to know when to shift.</p>\r\r<h4>Basic Procedures for Shifting Down</h4>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<uL>\r<li>Release accelerator, push in clutch, and shift to neutral at the same time.\r<li>Release clutch.\r<li>Press accelerator, increase engine and gear speed to the rpm required in the lower gear.\r<li>Push in clutch and shift to lower gear at the same time.\r<li>Release clutch and press accelerator at the same time.\r<li>Downshifting, like upshifting, requires knowing when to shift. Use either the tachometer or the speedometer and downshift at the right rpm or road speed.\r</ul></div>\r<p>Special conditions where you should downshift are:</p>\r\r<h4>Before Starting Down a Hill</h4>\r\r<p>Slow down and shift down to a speed that you can control without using the brakes hard. Otherwise the brakes can overheat and lose their braking power.</p>\r\r<p>Downshift before starting down the hill. Make sure you are in a low enough gear, usually lower than the gear required to climb the same hill.</p>\r\r<h4>Before Entering a Curve</h4>\r\r<p>Slow down to a safe speed, and downshift to the right gear before entering the curve. This lets you use some power through the curve to help the vehicle be more stable while turning. It also allows you to speed up as soon as you are out of the curve.</p>\r\r<h2>Automatic Transmissions</h2>\r\r<p>Some vehicles have automatic transmissions. You can select a low range to get greater engine braking when going downgrades. The lower ranges prevent the transmission from shifting up beyond the selected gear (unless the governor rpm is exceeded). It is very important to use this braking effect when going downgrades.</p>', 2, 204, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(414, 'di0032.1_03', '<h1>Seeing</h1><p>To be a safe driver you need to know what\'s going on all around your vehicle. Not looking properly is a major cause of accidents.</p>\r\r<h2>Seeing Ahead</h2>\r\r<p>All drivers look ahead, but many don\'t look far enough ahead.</p>\r\r<h4>Importance of Looking Far Enough Ahead</h4>\r\r<p>Because stopping or changing lanes can take a lot of distance, knowing what the traffic is doing on all sides of you is very important. You need to look well ahead to make sure you have room to make these moves safely.\r\r<h4>How Far Ahead to Look</h4>\r\r<p>Most good drivers look at least 12 to 15 seconds ahead. That means looking ahead the distance you will travel in 12 to 15 seconds. At lower speeds, that\'s about one block. At highway speeds it\'s about a quarter of a mile. If you\'re not looking that far ahead, you may have to stop too quickly or make quick lane changes. Looking 12 to 15 seconds ahead doesn\'t mean not paying attention to things that are closer. Good drivers shift their attention back and forth, near and far.\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:627}}</p>\n\r<h4>Look for Traffic</h4>\r\r<p>Look for vehicles coming onto the highway, into your lane, or turning. Watch for brake lights from slowing vehicles. By seeing these things far enough ahead, you can change your speed, or change lanes if necessary to avoid a problem. If a traffic light has been green for a long time it will probably change before you get there. Start slowing down and be ready to stop.\r\r<h2>Seeing to the Sides and Rear</h2>\r\r<p>It\'s important to know what\'s going on behind and to the sides. Check your mirrors regularly. Check more often in special situations.\r\r<h4>Mirror Adjustment</h4>\r\r<p>Mirror adjustment should be checked prior to the start of any trip and can only be checked accurately when the truck is straight. You should check and adjust each mirror to show some part of the vehicle. This will give you a reference point for judging the position of the other images.\r\r<h4>Regular Checks</h4>\r\r<p>You need to make regular checks of your mirrors to be aware of traffic and to check your vehicle.\r\r<h4>Traffic</h4>\r\r<p>Check your mirrors for vehicles on either side and in back of you. In an emergency, you may need to know whether you can make a quick lane change. Use your mirrors to spot overtaking vehicles. There are "blind spots" that your mirrors cannot show you. Check your mirrors regularly to know where other vehicles are around you, and to see if they move into your blind spots.\r\r<h4>Check Your Vehicle</h4>\r\r<p>Use the mirrors to keep an eye on your tires. It\'s one way to spot a tire fire. If you\'re carrying open cargo, you can use the mirrors to check it. Look for loose straps, ropes, or chains. Watch for a flapping or ballooning tarp.\r\r<h4>Special Situations</h4>\r\r<p>Special situations require more than regular mirror checks. These are lane changes, turns, merges, and tight maneuvers.\r\r<h4>Lane Changes</h4>\r\r<p>You need to check your mirrors to make sure no one is alongside you or about to pass you. Check your mirrors:\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Before you change lanes to make sure there is enough room.\r<li>After you have signaled, to check that no one has moved into your blind spot.\r<li>Right after you start the lane change, to double-check that your path is clear.\r<li>After you complete the lane change.\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Turns</h4>\r\r<p>In turns, check your mirrors to make sure the rear of your vehicle will not hit anything.\r\r<h4>Merges</h4>\r\r<p>When merging, use your mirrors to make sure the gap in traffic is large enough for you to enter safely.\r\r<h4>Tight Maneuvers</h4>\r\r<p>Any time you are driving in close quarters, check your mirrors often. Make sure you have enough clearance.\r\r<h4>How to Use Mirrors</h4>\r\r<p>Use mirrors correctly by checking them quickly and understanding what you see.\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:628}}</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>When you use your mirrors while driving on the road, check quickly. Look back and forth between the mirrors and the road ahead. Don\'t focus on the mirrors for too long. Otherwise, you will travel quite a distance without knowing what\'s happening ahead.\r<li>Many large vehicles have curved (convex, "fisheye," "spot," "bugeye") mirrors that show a wider area than flat mirrors. This is often helpful. But everything appears smaller in a convex mirror than it would if you were looking at it directly. Things also seem farther away than they really are. It\'s important to realize this and to allow for it. The figure below shows the field of vision using a convex mirror.\r</ul></div>', 3, 287, 1, NULL, NULL),

Warn other drivers in any of the following situations:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li><b>Trouble Ahead:</b> The size of your vehicle may make it hard for drivers behind you to see hazards ahead. If you see a hazard that will require slowing down, warn the drivers behind by flashing your brake lights.\r<li><b>Tight Turns:</b> Most car drivers don\'t know how slowly you have to go to make a tight turn in a large vehicle. Give drivers behind you warning by braking early and slowing gradually.\r<li><b>Stopping on the Road:</b> Truck and bus drivers sometimes stop in the roadway to unload cargo or passengers, or to stop at a railroad crossing. Warn following drivers by flashing your brake lights. Don\'t stop suddenly.\r<li><b>Driving Slowly:</b> Drivers often do not realize how fast they are catching up to a slow vehicle until they are very close. If you must drive slowly, alert following drivers by turning on your emergency flashers if it is legal. (Laws regarding the use of flashers differ from one state to another. Check the laws of the states where you will drive.)\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Don\'t Direct Traffic</h4>\r\r<p>Some drivers try to help out others by signaling when it is safe to pass.

Keep in mind certain mental and physical conditions can affect your perception distance. It can be affected greatly depending on visibility and the hazard itself. The average perception time for an alert driver is 1 ¾ seconds. At 55 mph this accounts for 142 feet traveled.</p>\r\r<h4>Reaction distance</h4>\r\r<p>The distance you will continue to travel, in ideal conditions; before you physically hit the brakes, in response to a hazard seen ahead. The average driver has a reaction time of ¾ second to 1 second.

	(418, 'di0032.1_07', '<h2>Matching Speed to the Road Surface</h2><p>You can\'t steer or brake a vehicle unless you have traction. Traction is friction between the tires and the road. There are some road conditions that reduce traction and call for lower speeds.</p>\r\r<h4>Slippery Surfaces</h4>\r\r<p>It will take longer to stop, and it will be harder to turn without skidding, when the road is slippery. Wet roads can double stopping distance. You must drive slower to be able to stop in the same distance as on a dry road. Reduce speed by about one-third (e.g., slow from 55 to about 35 mph) on a wet road. On packed snow, reduce speed by a half, or more. If the surface is icy, reduce speed to a crawl and stop driving as soon as you can safely do so.</p>\r\r<h4>Identifying Slippery Surfaces</h4>\r\r<p>Sometimes it\'s hard to know if the road is slippery. Here are some signs of slippery roads:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li><b>Shaded Areas:</b> Shady parts of the road will remain icy and slippery long after open areas have melted.\r<li><b>Bridges:</b> When the temperature drops, bridges will freeze before the road will. Be especially careful when the temperature is close to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.\r<li><b>Melting Ice:</b> Slight melting will make ice wet. Wet ice is much more slippery than ice that is not wet.\r<li><b>Black Ice:</b> Black ice is a thin layer that is clear enough that you can see the road underneath it. It makes the road look wet. Any time the temperature is below freezing and the road looks wet, watch out for black ice.\r<li><b>Vehicle Icing:</b> An easy way to check for ice is to open the window and feel the front of the mirror, mirror support, or antenna. If there\'s ice on these, the road surface is probably starting to ice up.\r<li><b>Just After Rain Begins:</b> Right after it starts to rain, the water mixes with oil left on the road by vehicles. This makes the road very slippery. If the rain continues, it will wash the oil away.\r<li><b>Hydroplaning:</b> In some weather, water or slush collects on the road. When this happens, your vehicle can hydroplane. It\'s like water skiing—the tires lose their contact with the road and have little or no traction. You may not be able to steer or brake. You can regain control by releasing the accelerator and pushing in the clutch. This will slow your vehicle and let the wheels turn freely. If the vehicle is hydroplaning, do <u>not</u> use the brakes to slow down. If the drive wheels start to skid, push in the clutch to let them turn freely.\r</ul></div>\r<p>It does not take a lot of water to cause hydroplaning. Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 30 mph if there is a lot of water. Hydroplaning is more likely if tire pressure is low, or the tread is worn. (The grooves in a tire carry away the water; if they aren\'t deep, they don\'t work well.)</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:634}}</p>\r\r<p>Road surfaces where water can collect can create conditions that cause a vehicle to hydroplane. Watch for clear reflections, tire splashes, and raindrops on the road.

The tires can lose their traction and continue straight ahead, so you skid off the road. Or, the tires may keep their traction and the vehicle rolls over. Tests have shown that trucks with a high center of gravity can roll over at the posted speed limit for a curve.</p>\r\r<p>Slow to a safe speed before you enter a curve. Braking in a curve is dangerous because it is easier to lock the wheels and cause a skid. Slow down as needed. Don\'t ever exceed the posted speed limit for the curve.

When you must use low beams, slow down.</p>\r\r<h2>Speed and Traffic Flow</h2>\r\r<p>When you\'re driving in heavy traffic, the safest speed is the speed of other vehicles. Vehicles going the same direction at the same speed are not likely to run into one another. In many states, speed limits are lower for trucks and buses than for cars. It can vary as much as 15 mph.

But, anyone trying to drive faster than the speed of traffic will not be able to save much time. The risks involved are not worth it. If you go faster than the speed of other traffic, you\'ll have to keep passing other vehicles. This increases the chance of a crash, and it is more tiring. Fatigue increases the chance of a crash. Going with the flow of traffic is safer and easier.</p>\r\r<h2>Speed on Downgrades</h2>\r\r<p>Your vehicle\'s speed will increase on downgrades because of gravity.

Also, look for and heed warning signs indicating the length and steepness of the grade. You must use the braking effect of the engine as the principal way of controlling your speed on downgrades. The braking effect of the engine is greatest when it is near the governed rpms and the transmission is in the lower gears. Save your brakes so you will be able to slow or stop as required by road and traffic conditions. Shift your transmission to a low gear before starting down the grade and use the proper braking techniques.</p>\r\r<h2>Roadway Work Zones</h2>\r\r<p>Speeding traffic is the number one cause of injury and death in roadway work zones. Observe the posted speed limits at all times when approaching and driving through a work zone.

Because of wide turning and offtracking, large vehicles can hit other vehicles or objects during turns.</p>\r\r<h4>Right Turns</h4>\r\r<p>Here are some rules to help prevent right-turn crashes:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Turn slowly to give yourself and others more time to avoid problems.\r<li>If you are driving a truck that cannot make the right turn without swinging into another lane, turn wide as you complete the turn. Keep the rear of your vehicle close to the curb. This will stop other drivers from passing you on the right.\r<li>Don\'t turn wide to the left as you start the turn. A following driver may think you are turning left and try to pass you on the right. You may crash into the other vehicle as you complete your turn.\r<li>If you must cross into the oncoming lane to make a turn, watch out for vehicles coming toward you. Give them room to go by or to stop. However, don\'t back up for them, because you might hit someone behind you.\r</ul></div>\r \r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:638}}</p>\n\r<h4>Left Turns</h4>\r\r<p>On a left turn, make sure you have reached the center of the intersection before you start the left turn. If you turn too soon, the left side of your vehicle may hit another vehicle because of offtracking.</p>\r\r<p>If there are two turning lanes, always take the right turn lane. Don\'t start in the inside lane because you may have to swing right to make the turn. Drivers on your left can be more readily seen.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:639}}</p>\r\r<h2>Space Needed to Cross or Enter Traffic</h2>\r\r<p>Be aware of the size and weight of your vehicle when you cross or enter traffic. Here are some important things to keep in mind.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green"><ul>\r<li>Because of slow acceleration and the space large vehicles require, you may need a much larger gap to enter traffic than you would in a car.\r<li>Acceleration varies with the load.

For example, a car in front of you is headed toward the freeway exit, but his brake lights come on and he begins braking hard. This could mean that the driver is uncertain about taking the off ramp. He might suddenly return to the highway. This car is a hazard. If the driver of the car cuts in front of you, it is no longer just a hazard; it is an emergency.</p>\r\r<h4>Seeing Hazards Lets You Be Prepared</h4>\r\r<p>You will have more time to act if you see hazards before they become emergencies. In the example above, you might make a lane change or slow down to prevent a crash if the car suddenly cuts in front of you. Seeing this hazard gives you time to check your mirrors and signal a lane change.</p>\r\r<p>Being prepared reduces the danger. A driver who did not see the hazard until the slow car pulled back on the highway in front of him would have to do something very suddenly. Sudden braking or a quick lane change is much more likely to lead to a crash.</p>\r\r<h4>Learning to See Hazards</h4>\r\r<p>There are often clues that will help you see hazards. The more you drive, the better you can learn to see hazards. This section will talk about hazards that you should be aware of.</p>\r\r<h2>Hazardous Roads</h2>\r\r<p>Slow down and be very careful if you see any of the following road hazards.</p>\r\r<h4>Work Zones</h4>\r\r<p>When people are working on the road, it is a hazard. There may be narrower lanes, sharp turns, or uneven surfaces. Other drivers are often distracted and drive unsafely. Workers and construction vehicles may get in the way. Drive slowly and carefully near work zones. Use your four-way flashers or brake lights to warn drivers behind you.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:640}}</p>\r\r<h4>Drop Off</h4>\r\r<p>Sometimes the pavement drops off sharply near the edge of the road. Driving too near the edge can tilt your vehicle toward the side of the road. This can cause the top of your vehicle to hit roadside objects (signs, tree limbs). Also, it can be hard to steer as you cross the drop off, going off the road, or coming back on.</p>\r\r<h4>Foreign Objects</h4>\r\r<p>Things that have fallen on the road can be hazards. They can be a danger to your tires and wheel rims. They can damage electrical and brake lines. They can be caught between dual tires and cause severe damage. Some obstacles that appear to be harmless can be very dangerous. For example, cardboard boxes may be empty, but they may also contain some solid or heavy material capable of causing damage. The same is true of paper and cloth sacks. It is important to remain alert for objects of all sorts, so you can see them early enough to avoid them without making sudden, unsafe moves.</p>\r\r<h4>Off Ramps/On Ramps</h4>\r\r<p>Freeway and turnpike exits can be particularly dangerous for commercial vehicles. Off ramps and on ramps often have speed limit signs posted. Remember, these speeds may be safe for automobiles, but may not be safe for larger vehicles or heavily loaded vehicles. Exits that go downhill and turn at the same time can be especially dangerous. The downgrade makes it difficult to reduce speed. Braking and turning at the same time can be a dangerous practice. Make sure you are going slowly enough before you get on the curved part of an off ramp or on ramp.</p>', 12, 226, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(424, 'di0032.1_13', '<h2>Drivers Who Are Hazards</h2><p>In order to protect yourself and others, you must know when other drivers may do something hazardous. Some clues to this type of hazard are discussed below.</p>\r\r<h4>Blocked Vision</h4>\r\r<p>People who can\'t see others are a very dangerous hazard. Be alert for drivers whose vision is blocked. Vans, loaded station wagons, and cars with the rear window blocked are examples. Rental trucks should be watched carefully. Their drivers are often not used to the limited vision they have to the sides and rear of the truck. In winter, vehicles with frosted, ice-covered, or snow-covered windows are hazards.</p>\r\r<p>Vehicles may be partly hidden by blind intersections or alleys. If you only can see the rear or front end of a vehicle but not the driver, then he or she can\'t see you. Be alert because he/she may back out or enter into your lane. Always be prepared to stop.</p>\r\r<h4>Delivery Trucks Can Present a Hazard</h4>\r\r<p>Packages or vehicle doors often block the driver’s vision. Drivers of step vans, postal vehicles, and local delivery vehicles often are in a hurry and may suddenly step out of their vehicle or drive their vehicle into the traffic lane.</p>\r\r<h4>Parked Vehicles</h4>\r\r<p>Parked vehicles can be hazards, especially when people start to get out of them. Or, they may suddenly start up and drive into your way. Watch for movement inside the vehicle or movement of the vehicle itself that shows people are inside. Watch for brake lights or backup lights, exhaust, and other clues that a driver is about to move.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:641}}</p>\r\r<p>Be careful of a stopped bus. Passengers may cross in front of or behind the bus, and they often can\'t see you.</p>\r\r<h4>Pedestrians and Bicyclists Can Also Be Hazards</h4>\r\r<p>Walkers, joggers, and bicyclists may be on the road with their back to the traffic, so they can\'t see you. Sometimes they wear portable stereos with headsets, so they can\'t hear you either. This can be dangerous. On rainy days, pedestrians may not see you because of hats or umbrellas. They may be hurrying to get out of the rain and may not pay attention to the traffic.</p>\r\r<h4>Distractions</h4>\r\r<p>People who are distracted are hazards. Watch for where they are looking. If they are looking elsewhere, they can\'t see you. But be alert even when they are looking at you. They may believe that they have the right of way.</p>\r\r<h4>Children</h4>\r\r<p>Children tend to act quickly without checking traffic. Children playing with one another may not look for traffic and are a serious hazard.</p>\r\r<h4>Talkers</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers or pedestrians talking to one another may not be paying close attention to the traffic.</p>\r\r<h4>Workers</h4>\r\r<p>People working on or near the roadway are a hazard clue. The work creates a distraction for other drivers and the workers themselves may not see you.</p>\r\r<h4>Ice Cream Trucks</h4>\r\r<p>Someone selling ice cream is a hazard clue. Children may be nearby and may not see you.</p>\r\r<h4>Disabled Vehicles</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers changing a tire or fixing an engine often do not pay attention to the danger that roadway traffic is to them. They are often careless. Jacked up wheels or raised hoods are hazard clues.</p>\r\r<h4>Accidents</h4>\r\r<p>Accidents are particularly hazardous. People involved in the accident may not look for traffic. Passing drivers tend to look at the accident. People often run across the road without looking. Vehicles may slow or stop suddenly.</p>\r\r<h4>Shoppers</h4>\r\r<p>People in and around shopping areas are often not watching traffic because they are looking for stores or looking into store windows.</p>\r\r<h4>Confused Drivers</h4>\r\r<p>Confused drivers often change direction suddenly or stop without warning. Confusion is common near freeway or turnpike interchanges and major intersections. Tourists unfamiliar with the area can be very hazardous. Clues to tourists include car-top luggage and out-of-state license plates. Unexpected actions (stopping in the middle of a block, changing lanes for no apparent reason, backup lights suddenly going on) are clues to confusion. Hesitation is another clue, including driving very slowly, using brakes often, or stopping in the middle of an intersection. You may also see drivers who are looking at street signs, maps, and house numbers. These drivers may not be paying attention to you.</p>\r\r<h4>Slow Drivers</h4>\r\r<p>Motorists who fail to maintain normal speed are hazards. Seeing slow moving vehicles early can prevent a crash. Some vehicles, by their nature, are slow and seeing them is a hazard clue (mopeds, farm machinery, construction machinery, tractors, etc.). Some of these will have the "slow moving vehicle" symbol to warn you. This is a red triangle with an orange center. Watch for it.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:642}}</p>\r\r<h4>Drivers Signaling a Turn May Be a Hazard</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers signaling a turn may slow more than expected or stop. If they are making a tight turn into an alley or driveway, they may go very slowly. If pedestrians or other vehicles block them, they may have to stop on the roadway. Vehicles turning left may have to stop for oncoming vehicles.</p>\r\r<h4>Drivers in a Hurry</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers may feel your commercial vehicle is preventing them from getting where they want to go on time. Such drivers may pass you without a safe gap in the oncoming traffic, cutting too close in front of you. Drivers entering the road may pull in front of you in order to avoid being stuck behind you, causing you to brake. Be aware of this and watch for drivers who are in a hurry.</p>\r\r<h4>Impaired Drivers</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers who are sleepy, have had too much to drink, are on drugs, or who are ill are hazards. Some clues to these drivers are:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Weaving across the road or drifting from one side to another.\r<li>Leaving the road (dropping right wheels onto the shoulder, or bumping across a curb in a turn).\r<li>Stopping at the wrong time (stopping at a green light, or waiting for too long at a stop).\r<li>Open window in cold weather.\r<li>Speeding up or slowing down suddenly, driving too fast or too slow.\r</ul></div>\r<p>Be alert for drunk drivers and sleepy drivers late at night.</p>\r\r<h4>Driver Body Movement as a Clue</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers look in the direction they are going to turn. You may sometimes get a clue from a driver\'s head and body movements that a driver may be going to make a turn, even though the turn signals aren\'t on. Drivers making over-the-shoulder checks may be going to change lanes. These clues are most easily seen in motorcyclists and bicyclists. Watch other road users and try to tell whether they might do something hazardous.</p>\r\r<h4>Conflicts</h4>\r\r<p>You are in conflict when you have to change speed and/or direction to avoid hitting someone. Conflicts occur at intersections where vehicles meet, at merges (such as turnpike on ramps), and where there are needed lane changes (such as the end of a lane, forcing a move to another lane of traffic). Other situations include slow moving or stalled traffic in a traffic lane, and accident scenes. Watch for other drivers who are in conflict because they are a hazard to you. When they react to this conflict, they may do something that will put them in conflict with you.</p>\r\r<h2>Always Have a Plan</h2>\r\r<p>You should always be looking for hazards. Continue to learn to see hazards on the road. However, don\'t forget why you are looking for the hazards—they may turn into emergencies. You look for the hazards in order to have time to plan a way out of any emergency. When you see a hazard, think about the emergencies that could develop and figure out what you would do. Always be prepared to take action based on your plans. In this way, you will be a prepared, defensive driver who will improve your own safety as well as the safety of all road users.</p>', 13, 579, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(425, 'di0032.1_14', '<h1>Distracted Driving</h1><p>Whenever you are driving a vehicle and your attention is not on the road, you’re putting yourself, your passengers, other vehicles, and pedestrians in danger. Distracted driving can result when you perform any activity that may shift your full attention from the driving task. Taking your eyes off the road or hands off the steering wheel presents obvious driving risks. Mental activities that take your mind away from driving are just as dangerous. Your eyes can gaze at objects in the driving scene but fail to see them because your attention is distracted elsewhere.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:643}}</p>\r\r<p>Activities that can distract your attention include: talking to passengers; adjusting the radio, CD player, or climate controls; eating, drinking, or smoking; reading maps or other literature; picking up something that fell; reading billboards and other road advertisements; watching other people and vehicles including aggressive drivers; talking on a cell phone or CB radio; using telematic devices (such as navigation systems); daydreaming or being occupied with other mental distractions.</p>\r\r<h2>Don’t Drive Distracted</h2>\r\r<p>If drivers react a half-second slower because of distractions, crashes double. Some tips to follow so you won’t become distracted:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Review and be totally familiar with all safety and usage features on any in-vehicle electronics, including your cell phone, before you drive.\r<li>Pre-program radio stations.\r<li>Pre-load your favorite CDs or playlists.\r<li>Clear the vehicle of any unnecessary objects.\r<li>Review maps and plan your route before you begin driving.\r<li>Adjust all mirrors for best all-round visibility before you start your trip.\r<li>Don’t attempt to read or write while you drive.\r<li>Avoid smoking, eating, and drinking while you drive.\r</ul></div>\r<h2>Use In-vehicle Communication Equipment Cautiously</h2>\r<div class="callout callout-green"><ul>\r<li>Don’t engage in complex or emotionally intense conversations with other occupants. \r<li>When possible, pull off the road in a safe, legal place when making/receiving a call on communication equipment.\r<li>If possible, turn the cell phone off until your destination is reached.\r<li>Position the cell phone within easy reach.\r<li>Pre-program cell phones with commonly called numbers.\r<li>If you have to place a call, find a safe place to pull off the road. Do not place a call while driving.\r<li>Some jurisdictions require that only hands-free devices can be used while driving. Even these devices are unsafe to use when you are moving down the road. (See course {{COURSE_NUMBER_TITLE:14}}, for state-specific regulations on cell phone use and texting.) \r<li>If you must use your cell phone, keep conversations short. Develop ways to get free of long-winded friends and associates while on the road. Never use the cell phone for social visiting.\r<li>Hang up in tricky traffic situations.\r<li>Do not use the equipment when approaching locations with heavy traffic, road construction, heavy pedestrian traffic, or severe weather conditions.\r<li>Do not attempt to type or read messages on your satellite system while driving.\r</ul></div>\r<h2>Watch Out for Other Distracted Drivers</h2>\r\r<p>You need to be able to recognize other drivers who are engaged in any form of driving distraction. Not recognizing other distracted drivers can prevent you from perceiving or reacting correctly in time to prevent a crash. Watch for:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow"><ul>\r<li>Vehicles that may drift over the lane divider lines or within their own lane.\r<li>Vehicles traveling at inconsistent speeds.\r<li>Drivers who are preoccupied with maps, food, cigarettes, cell phones, or other objects.\r<li>Drivers who appear to be involved in conversations with their passengers.\r</ul></div>\r<p>Give a distracted driver plenty of room and maintain your safe following distance.

Road rage is operating a motor vehicle with the intent of doing harm to others or physically assaulting a driver or their vehicle.</p>\r\r<h2>Don’t Be an Aggressive Driver</h2>\r\r<p>How you feel before you even start your vehicle has a lot to do with how stress will affect you while driving.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Reduce your stress before and while you drive. Listen to “easy listening” music.\r<li>Give the drive your full attention. Don’t allow yourself to become distracted by talking on your cell phone, eating, etc.\r<li>Be realistic about your travel time. Expect delays because of traffic, construction, or bad weather and make allowances.\r<li>If you’re going to be later than you expected—deal with it. Take a deep breath and accept the delay.\r<li>Give other drivers the benefit of the doubt. Try to imagine why he or she is driving that way. Whatever their reason, it has nothing to do with you.\r<li>Slow down and keep your following distance reasonable.\r<li>Don’t drive slowly in the left lane of traffic.\r<li>Avoid gestures.

	(427, 'di0032.2_02', '<h1>Driving at Night</h1><p>You are at greater risk when you drive at night. Drivers can\'t see hazards as quickly as in daylight, so they have less time to respond. Drivers caught by surprise are less able to avoid a crash. The problems of night driving involve the driver, the roadway, and the vehicle.</p>\r\r<h2>Driver Factors</h2>\r\r<h4>Vision</h4>\r\r<p>People can\'t see as sharply at night or in dim light. Also, their eyes need time to adjust to seeing in dim light. Most people have noticed this when walking into a dark movie theater.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:645}}</p>\r\r<h4>Glare</h4>\r\r<p>Drivers can be blinded for a short time by bright light. It takes time to recover from this blindness. Older drivers are especially bothered by glare. Most people have been temporarily blinded by camera flash units or by the high beams of an oncoming vehicle. It can take several seconds to recover from glare. Even two seconds of glare blindness can be dangerous. A vehicle going 55 mph will travel more than half the distance of a football field during that time. Don\'t look directly at bright lights when driving. Look at the right side of the road. Watch the sidelines when someone coming toward you has very bright lights on.</p>\r\r<h4>Fatigue and Lack of Alertness</h4>\r\r<p>Fatigue and lack of alertness are bigger problems at night. The body\'s need for sleep is beyond a person\'s control. Most people are less alert at night, especially after midnight. This is particularly true if you have been driving for a long time. Drivers may not see hazards as soon, or react as quickly, so the chance of a crash is greater. If you are sleepy, the only safe cure is to get off the road and get some sleep. If you don\'t, you risk your life and the lives of others.</p>\r\r<h2>Roadway Factors</h2>\r\r<h4>Poor Lighting</h4>\r\r<p>In the daytime there is usually enough light to see well. This is not true at night. Some areas may have bright streetlights, but many areas will have poor lighting. On most roads you will probably have to depend entirely on your headlights.</p>\r\r<p>Less light means you will not be able to see hazards as well as in daytime. Road users who do not have lights are hard to see. There are many accidents at night involving pedestrians, joggers, bicyclists, and animals.</p>\r\r<p>Even when there are lights, the road scene can be confusing. Traffic signals and hazards can be hard to see against a background of signs, shop windows, and other lights. Drive slower when lighting is poor or confusing. Drive slowly enough to be sure you can stop in the distance you can see ahead.</p>\r\r<h4>Drunk Drivers</h4>\r\r<p>Drunk drivers and drivers under the influence of drugs are a hazard to themselves and to you. Be especially alert around the closing times for bars and taverns. Watch for drivers who have trouble staying in their lane or maintaining speed, who stop without reason, or show other signs of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>', 2, 192, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(428, 'di0032.2_03', '<h2>Vehicle Factors</h2><h4>Headlights</h4><p>At night your headlights will usually be the main source of light for you to see by and for others to see you. You can\'t see nearly as much with your headlights as you see in the daytime. With low beams you can see ahead about 250 feet and with high beams about 350-500 feet. You must adjust your speed to keep your stopping distance within your sight distance. This means going slowly enough to be able to stop within the range of your headlights. Otherwise, by the time you see a hazard, you will not have time to stop.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:646}}</p>\r\r<p>Night driving can be more dangerous if you have problems with your headlights. Dirty headlights may give only half the light they should. This cuts down your ability to see, and makes it harder for others to see you. Make sure your lights are clean and working. Headlights can be out of adjustment. If they don\'t point in the right direction, they won\'t give you a good view and they can blind other drivers. Have a qualified person make sure they are adjusted properly.</p>\r\r<h4>Other Lights</h4>\r\r<p>In order for you to be seen easily, the following must be clean and working properly:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Reflectors\r<li>Marker lights\r<li>Clearance lights\r<li>Taillights\r<li>Identification lights\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Turn Signals and Brake Lights</h4>\r\r<p>At night your turn signals and brake lights are even more important for telling other drivers what you intend to do. Make sure you have clean, working turn signals and stop lights.</p>\r\r<h4>Windshield and Mirrors</h4>\r\r<p>It is more important at night than in the daytime to have a clean windshield and clean mirrors. Bright lights at night can cause dirt on your windshield or mirrors to create a glare of its own, blocking your view. Most people have experienced driving toward the sun just as it has risen or is about to set, and found that they can barely see through a windshield that seemed to look OK in the middle of the day. Clean your windshield on the inside and outside for safe driving at night.</p>\r\r<h2>Night Driving Procedures</h2>\r\r<h4>Pre-trip Procedures</h4>\r\r<p>Make sure you are rested and alert. If you are drowsy, sleep before you drive! Even a nap can save your life or the lives of others. If you wear eyeglasses, make sure they are clean and unscratched. Don\'t wear sunglasses at night. Do a complete pre-trip inspection of your vehicle. Pay attention to checking all lights and reflectors, and cleaning those you can reach.</p>\r\r<h4>Avoid Blinding Others</h4>\r\r<p>Glare from your headlights can cause problems for drivers coming toward you. They can also bother drivers going in the same direction you are, when your lights shine in their rearview mirrors. Dim your lights before they cause glare for other drivers. Dim your lights within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle and when following another vehicle within 500 feet.</p>\r\r<h4>Avoid Glare from Oncoming Vehicles</h4>\r\r<p>Do not look directly at lights of oncoming vehicles. Look slightly to the right at a right lane or edge marking, if available. If other drivers don\'t put their low beams on, don\'t try to "get back at them" by putting your own high beams on. This increases glare for oncoming drivers and increases the chance of a crash.</p>\r\r<h4>Use High Beams When You Can</h4>\r\r<p>Some drivers make the mistake of always using low beams. This seriously cuts down on their ability to see ahead. Use high beams when it is safe and legal to do so. Use them when you are not within 500 feet of an approaching vehicle. Also, don\'t let the inside of your cab get too bright. This makes it harder to see outside. Keep the interior light off, and adjust your instrument lights as low as you can to still be able to read the gauges.</p>\r\r<h4>If You Get Sleepy, Stop at the Nearest Safe Place</h4>\r\r<p>People often don\'t realize how close they are to falling asleep even when their eyelids are falling shut. If you can safely do so, look at yourself in a mirror. If you look sleepy, or you just feel sleepy, stop driving! You are in a very dangerous condition. The only safe cure is to sleep.</p>', 3, 259, 1, NULL, NULL),

You should watch for foggy conditions and be ready to reduce your speed. Do not assume that the fog will thin out after you enter it.</p>\r\r<p>The best advice for driving in fog is don’t. It is preferable that you pull off the road into a rest area or truck stop until visibility is better. If you must drive, be sure to consider the following:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Obey all fog-related warning signs.\r<li>Slow down before you enter fog.\r<li>Use low-beam headlights and fog lights for best visibility even in daytime, and be alert for other drivers who may have forgotten to turn on their lights.\r<li>Turn on your 4-way flashers. This will give vehicles approaching you from behind a quicker opportunity to notice your vehicle.\r<li>Watch for vehicles on the side of the roadway. Seeing taillights or headlights in front of you may not be a true indication of where the road is ahead of you. The vehicle may not be on the road at all.\r<li>Use roadside highway reflectors as guides to determine how the road may curve ahead of you.\r<li>Listen for traffic you cannot see.\r<li>Avoid passing other vehicles.\r<li>Don’t stop along the side of the road, unless absolutely necessary.\r</ul></div>\r<h1>Driving in Winter</h1>\r\r<p>Make sure your vehicle is ready before driving in winter weather. You should make a regular pre-trip inspection, paying extra attention to the following items.</p>\r\r<h4>Coolant Level and Antifreeze Amount</h4>\r\r<p>Make sure the cooling system is full and there is enough antifreeze in the system to protect against freezing. This can be checked with a special coolant tester.</p>\r\r<h4>Defrosting and Heating Equipment</h4>\r\r<p>Make sure the defrosters work. They are needed for safe driving. Make sure the heater is working, and that you know how to operate it. If you use other heaters and expect to need them (e.g., mirror heaters, battery box heaters, fuel tank heaters), check their operation.</p>\r\r<h4>Wipers and Washers</h4>\r\r<p>Make sure the windshield wiper blades are in good condition. Make sure the wiper blades press against the window hard enough to wipe the windshield clean, otherwise they may not sweep off snow properly. Make sure the windshield washer works and there is washing fluid in the washer reservoir.</p>\r\r<p>Use windshield washer antifreeze to prevent freezing of the washer liquid. If you can\'t see well enough while driving (for example, if your wipers fail), stop safely and fix the problem.</p>\r\r<h4>Tires</h4>\r\r<p>Make sure you have enough tread on your tires. The drive tires must provide traction to push the rig over wet pavement and through snow. The steering tires must have traction to steer the vehicle. Enough tread is especially important in winter conditions. You must have at least 4/32 inch tread depth in every major groove on front tires and at least 2/32 inch on other tires. More would be better. Use a gauge to determine if you have enough tread for safe driving.</p>\r\r<h4>Tire Chains</h4>\r\r<p>You may find yourself in conditions where you can\'t drive without chains, even to get to a place of safety. Carry the right number of chains and extra cross-links. Make sure they will fit your drive tires. Check the chains for broken hooks, worn or broken cross-links, and bent or broken side chains. Learn how to put the chains on before you need to do it in snow and ice.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:647}}</p>\r\r<h4>Lights and Reflectors</h4>\r\r<p>Make sure the lights and reflectors are clean. Lights and reflectors are especially important during bad weather. Check from time to time during bad weather to make sure they are clean and working properly.</p>\r\r<h4>Windows and Mirrors</h4>\r\r<p>Remove any ice, snow, etc., from the windshield, windows, and mirrors before starting. Use a windshield scraper, snowbrush, and windshield defroster as necessary.</p>\r\r<h4>Hand Holds, Steps, and Deck Plates</h4>\r\r<p>Remove all ice and snow from hand holds, steps, and deck plates. This will reduce the danger of slipping.</p>\r\r<h4>Radiator Shutters and Winterfront</h4>\r\r<p>Remove ice from the radiator shutters. Make sure the winterfront is not closed too tightly. If the shutters freeze shut or the winterfront is closed too much, the engine may overheat and stop.</p>\r\r<h4>Exhaust System</h4>\r\r<p>Exhaust system leaks are especially dangerous when cab ventilation may be poor (windows rolled up, etc.). Loose connections could permit poisonous carbon monoxide to leak into your vehicle. Carbon monoxide gas will cause you to be sleepy. In large enough amounts it can kill you. Check the exhaust system for loose parts and for sounds and signs of leaks.</p>', 4, 305, 1, NULL, NULL),

Don\'t hurry.</p>\r\r<h4>Check for Ice</h4>\r\r<p>Check for ice on the road, especially bridges and overpasses. A lack of spray from other vehicles indicates ice has formed on the road. Also, check your mirrors and wiper blades for ice. If they have ice, the road most likely will be icy as well.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:648}}</p>\r\r<h4>Adjust Turning and Braking to Conditions</h4>\r\r<p>Make turns as gently as possible. Don\'t brake any harder than necessary, and don\'t use the engine brake or speed retarder. (They can cause the driving wheels to skid on slippery surfaces.)</p>\r\r<h4>Adjust Speed to Conditions</h4>\r\r<p>Don\'t pass slower vehicles unless necessary. Go slowly and watch far enough ahead to keep a steady speed. Avoid having to slow down and speed up. Take curves at slower speeds and don\'t brake while in curves. Be aware that as the temperature rises to the point where ice begins to melt, the road becomes even more slippery. Slow down more.</p>\r\r<h4>Adjust Space to Conditions</h4>\r\r<p>Don\'t drive alongside other vehicles. Keep a longer following distance. When you see a traffic jam ahead, slow down or stop to wait for it to clear. Try hard to anticipate stops early and slow down gradually. Watch for snowplows, as well as salt and sand trucks, and give them plenty of room.</p>\r\r<h4>Wet Brakes</h4>\r\r<p>When driving in heavy rain or deep standing water, your brakes will get wet. Water in the brakes can cause the brakes to be weak, to apply unevenly, or to grab. This can cause lack of braking power, wheel lockups, pulling to one side or the other, and jackknife if you pull a trailer.</p>\r\r<p>Avoid driving through deep puddles or flowing water if possible. If not, you should:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Slow down and place transmission in a low gear.\r<li>Gently put on the brakes.

Following the safety practices in this manual can help prevent emergencies. But if an emergency does happen, your chances of avoiding a crash depend upon how well you take action. Actions you can take are discussed below.</p>\r\r<h4>Steering to Avoid a Crash</h4>\r\r<p>Stopping is not always the safest thing to do in an emergency. When you don\'t have enough room to stop, you may have to steer away from what\'s ahead. Remember, you can almost always turn to miss an obstacle more quickly than you can stop. (However, top-heavy vehicles and tractors with multiple trailers may flip over.)</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:655}}</p>\r\r<h4>Keep Both Hands on the Steering Wheel</h4>\r\r<p>In order to turn quickly, you must have a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands. The best way to have both hands on the wheel, if there is an emergency, is to keep them there all the time.</p>\r\r<h4>How to Turn Quickly and Safely</h4>\r\r<p>A quick turn can be made safely, if it\'s done the right way. Here are some points that safe drivers use:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Do not apply the brake while you are turning. It\'s very easy to lock your wheels while turning. If that happens, you may skid out of control.\r<li>Do not turn any more than needed to clear whatever is in your way. The more sharply you turn, the greater the chances of a skid or rollover.\r<li>Be prepared to "countersteer," that is, to turn the wheel back in the other direction, once you\'ve passed whatever was in your path. Unless you are prepared to countersteer, you won\'t be able to do it quickly enough. You should think of emergency steering and countersteering as two parts of one driving action.\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Where to Steer</h4>\r\r<p>If an oncoming driver has drifted into your lane, a move to your right is best. If that driver realizes what has happened, the natural response will be to return to his or her own lane.</p>\r\r<p>If something is blocking your path, the best direction to steer will depend on the situation.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green"><ul>\r<li>If you have been using your mirrors, you\'ll know which lane is empty and can be safely used.\r<li>If the shoulder is clear, going right may be best. No one is likely to be driving on the shoulder but someone may be passing you on the left. You will know if you have been using your mirrors.\r<li>If you are blocked on both sides, a move to the right may be best. At least you won\'t force anyone into an opposing traffic lane and a possible head-on collision.\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Leaving the Road</h4>\r\r<p>In some emergencies, you may have to drive off the road. It may be less risky than facing a collision with another vehicle.</p>\r\r<p>Most shoulders are strong enough to support the weight of a large vehicle and, therefore, offer an available escape route. Here are some guidelines, if you do leave the road.</p>\r\r<h4>Avoid Braking</h4>\r\r<p>If possible, avoid using the brakes until your speed has dropped to about 20 mph. Then brake very gently to avoid skidding on a loose surface.</p>\r\r<h4>Keep One Set of Wheels on the Pavement, if Possible</h4>\r\r<p>This helps to maintain control.</p>\r\r<h4>Stay on the Shoulder</h4>\r\r<p>If the shoulder is clear, stay on it until your vehicle has come to a stop. Signal and check your mirrors before pulling back onto the road.</p>\r\r<h4>Returning to the Road</h4>\r\r<p>If you are forced to return to the road before you can stop, use the following procedure:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow"><ul>\r<li>Hold the wheel tightly and turn sharply enough to get right back on the road safely. Don\'t try to edge gradually back on the road. If you do, your tires might grab unexpectedly and you could lose control.\r<li>When both front tires are on the paved surface, countersteer immediately.

(It can take up to one second for the wheels to start rolling after you release the brakes. If you re-apply the brakes before the wheels start rolling, the vehicle won\'t straighten out.)\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Don\'t Jam on the Brakes</h4>\r\r<p>Emergency braking does not mean pushing down on the brake pedal as hard as you can. That will only keep the wheels locked up and cause a skid. If the wheels are skidding, you cannot control the vehicle.</p>\r\r<h2>Brake Failure</h2>\r\r<p>Brakes kept in good condition rarely fail. Most hydraulic brake failures occur for one of two reasons:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green"><ul>\r<li>Loss of hydraulic pressure.\r<li>Brake fade on long hills.\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Loss of Hydraulic Pressure</h4>\r\r<p>When the system won\'t build up pressure, the brake pedal will feel spongy or go to the floor. Here are some things you can do.</p>\r\r<h4>Downshift</h4>\r\r<p>Putting the vehicle into a lower gear will help to slow the vehicle.</p>\r\r<h4>Pump the Brakes</h4>\r\r<p>Sometimes pumping the brake pedal will generate enough hydraulic pressure to stop the vehicle.</p>\r\r<h4>Use the Parking Brake</h4>\r\r<p>The parking or emergency brake is separate from the hydraulic brake system. Therefore, it can be used to slow the vehicle. However, be sure to press the release button or pull the release lever at the same time you use the emergency brake so you can adjust the brake pressure and keep the wheels from locking up.</p>\r\r<h4>Find an Escape Route</h4>\r\r<p>While slowing the vehicle, look for an escape route—an open field, side street, or escape ramp. Turning uphill is a good way to slow and stop the vehicle. Make sure the vehicle does not start rolling backward after you stop. Put it in low gear, apply the parking brake, and, if necessary, roll back into some obstacle that will stop the vehicle.</p>\r\r<h4>Brake Failure on Downgrades</h4>\r\r<p>Going slow enough and braking properly will almost always prevent brake failure on long downgrades. Once the brakes have failed, however, you are going to have to look outside your vehicle for something to stop it.</p>\r\r<p>Your best hope is an escape ramp. If there is one, there\'ll be signs telling you about it. Use it. Ramps are usually located a few miles from the top of the downgrade. Every year, hundreds of drivers avoid injury to themselves or damage to their vehicles by using escape ramps. Some escape ramps use soft gravel that resists the motion of the vehicle and brings it to a stop. Others turn uphill, using the hill to stop the vehicle and soft gravel to hold it in place.</p>\r\r<p>Any driver who loses brakes going downhill should use an escape ramp if it\'s available. If you don\'t use it, your chances of having a serious crash may be much greater.</p>\r\r<p>If no escape ramp is available, take the least hazardous escape route you can—such as an open field or a side road that flattens out or turns uphill. Make the move as soon as you know your brakes don\'t work. The longer you wait, the faster the vehicle will go, and the harder it will be to stop.</p>\r\r<h2>Tire Failure</h2>\r\r<h4>Recognize Tire Failure</h4>\r\r<p>Quickly knowing you have a tire failure will let you have more time to react. Having just a few extra seconds to remember what it is you\'re supposed to do can help you. The major signs of tire failure are:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow"><ul>\r<li>Sound. The loud "bang" of a blowout is an easily recognized sign. Because it can take a few seconds for your vehicle to react, you might think it was some other vehicle. But any time you hear a tire blow, you\'d be safest to assume it is yours.\r<li>Vibration. If the vehicle thumps or vibrates heavily, it may be a sign that one of the tires has gone flat. With a rear tire, that may be the only sign you get.\r<li>Feel. If the steering feels "heavy," it is probably a sign that one of the front tires has failed. Sometimes, failure of a rear tire will cause the vehicle to slide back and forth or "fishtail." However, dual rear tires usually prevent this.\r</ul></div>\r<h4>Respond to Tire Failure</h4>\r\r<p>When a tire fails, your vehicle is in danger. You must immediately:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Hold the Steering Wheel Firmly. If a front tire fails, it can twist the steering wheel out of your hand. The only way to prevent this is to keep a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands at all times.\r<li>Stay Off the Brake. It\'s natural to want to brake in an emergency. However, braking when a tire has failed could cause loss of control. Unless you\'re about to run into something, stay off the brake until the vehicle has slowed down. Then brake very gently, pull off the road, and stop.\r<li>Check the Tires. After you\'ve come to a stop, get out and check all the tires. Do this even if the vehicle seems to be handling all right. If one of your dual tires goes, the only way you may know it is by getting out and looking at it.\r</ul></div>', 10, 360, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(436, 'di0032.2_11', '<h1>Antilock Braking Systems (ABS)</h1><p>ABS is a computerized system that keeps your wheels from locking up during hard brake applications. ABS is an addition to your normal brakes. It does not decrease or increase your normal braking capability. ABS only activates when wheels are about to lock up. ABS does not necessarily shorten your stopping distance, but it does help you keep the vehicle under control during hard braking.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:657}}</p>\r\r<h2>How Antilock Braking Systems Work</h2>\r\r<p>Sensors detect potential wheel lock up. An electronic control unit (ECU) will then decrease brake pressure to avoid wheel lockup. Brake pressure is adjusted to provide the maximum braking without danger of lockup.</p>\r\r<p>ABS works far faster than the driver can respond to potential wheel lockup. At all other times the brake system will operate normally.</p>\r\r<h2>Vehicles Required to Have Antilock Braking Systems</h2>\r\r<p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that ABS be on:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Truck tractors with air brakes built on or after March 1, 1997.\r<li>Other air brake vehicles, (trucks, buses, trailers, and converter dollies) built on or after March 1, 1998.\r<li>Hydraulically braked trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or more built on or after March 1, 1999.\r</ul></div>\r<p>Many commercial vehicles built before these dates have been voluntarily equipped with ABS.</p>\r\r<h2>How to Know If Your Vehicle Is Equipped with ABS</h2>\r\r<p>Tractors, trucks, and buses will have yellow ABS malfunction lamps on the instrument panel. Trailers will have yellow ABS malfunction lamps on the left side, either on the front or rear corner. Dollies manufactured on or after March 1, 1998, are required to have a lamp on the left side.</p>\r\r<p>As a system check on newer vehicles, the malfunction lamp comes on at start-up for a bulb check, and then goes out quickly. On older systems, the lamp could stay on until you are driving over five mph.</p>\r\r<p>If the lamp stays on after the bulb check, or goes on once you are under way, you may have lost ABS control. In the case of towed units manufactured before it was required by the DOT, it may be difficult to tell if the unit is equipped with ABS. Look under the vehicle for the ECU and wheel speed sensor wires coming from the back of the brakes.</p>\r\r<h2>How ABS Helps You</h2>\r\r<p>When you brake hard on slippery surfaces in a vehicle without ABS, your wheels may lock up. When your steering wheels lock up, you lose steering control. When your other wheels lock up, you may skid, jackknife, or even spin the vehicle.</p>\r\r<p>ABS helps you avoid wheel lock up and maintain control. You may or may not be able to stop faster with ABS, but you should be able to steer around an obstacle while braking, and avoid skids caused by over braking.</p>', 11, 190, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(437, 'di0032.2_12', '<h2>ABS on the Tractor Only or Only on the Trailer</h2><p>Having ABS on only the tractor, only the trailer, or even on only one axle, still gives you more control over the vehicle during braking. Brake normally.</p>\r\r<p>When only the tractor has ABS, you should be able to maintain steering control, and there is less chance of jackknifing. But keep your eye on the trailer and let up on the brakes (if you can safely do so) if it begins to swing out.</p>\r\r<p>When only the trailer has ABS, the trailer is less likely to swing out, but if you lose steering control or start a tractor jackknife, let up on the brakes (if you can safely do so) until you regain control.</p>\r\r<h2>Braking with ABS</h2>\r\r<p>When you drive a vehicle with ABS, you should brake as you always have. In other words:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Use only the braking force necessary to stop safely and stay in control.\r<li>Brake the same way, regardless of whether you have ABS on the bus, tractor, the trailer, or both.\r<li>As you slow down, monitor your tractor and trailer and back off the brakes (if it is safe to do so) to stay in control.\r</ul></div>\r<p>There is only one exception to this procedure. If you drive a straight truck or combination with working ABS on all axles, in an emergency stop, you can fully apply the brakes.</p>\r\r<h2>Braking If ABS Is Not Working</h2>\r\r<p>Without ABS you still have normal brake functions. Drive and brake as you always have. Vehicles with ABS have yellow malfunction lamps to tell you if something isn’t working. As a system check on newer vehicles, the malfunction lamp comes on at start-up for a bulb check and then goes out quickly. On older systems, the lamp could stay on until you are driving over five mph.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:658}}</p>\r\r<p>If the lamp stays on after the bulb check, or goes on once you are under way, you may have lost ABS control on one or more wheels. Remember, if your ABS malfunctions, you still have regular brakes. Drive normally, but get the system serviced soon.</p>\r\r<h2>Safety Reminders</h2>\r<div class="callout callout-green"><ul>\r<li>ABS won’t allow you to drive faster, follow more closely, or drive less carefully.\r<li>ABS won’t prevent power or turning skids—ABS should prevent brake-induced skids or jackknifes, but not those caused by spinning the drive wheels or going too fast in a turn.\r<li>ABS won’t necessarily shorten stopping distance. ABS will help maintain vehicle control, but not always shorten stopping distance.\r<li>ABS won’t increase or decrease ultimate stopping power–ABS is an “add-on” to your normal brakes, not a replacement for them.\r<li>ABS won’t change the way you normally brake. Under normal brake conditions, your vehicle will stop as it always stopped. ABS only comes into play when a wheel would normally have locked up because of over braking.\r<li>ABS won’t compensate for bad brakes or poor brake maintenance.\r<li>Remember: The best vehicle safety feature is still a safe driver.\r<li>Remember: Drive so you never need to use your ABS.\r<li>Remember: If you need it, ABS could help to prevent a serious crash.\r</ul></div>', 12, 203, 1, NULL, NULL),

	(440, 'di0032.2_15', '<h1>Staying Alert and Fit to Drive</h1><p>Driving a vehicle for long hours is tiring. Even the best of drivers will become less alert. However, there are things that good drivers do to help stay alert and safe.</p>\r\r<h2>Be Ready to Drive</h2>\r\r<h4>Get Enough Sleep</h4>\n<p>Sleep is not like money. You can’t save it up ahead of time and you can’t borrow it. But, just as with money, you can go into debt with it. If you don’t sleep enough, you “owe” more sleep to yourself. This debt can only be paid off by sleeping. You can’t overcome it with willpower, and it won’t go away by itself. The average person needs seven or eight hours of sleep every 24 hours. Leaving on a long trip when you\'re already tired is dangerous. If you have a long trip scheduled, make sure that you get enough sleep before you go.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:661}}</p>\r\r<h4>Schedule Trips Safely</h4>\r\r<p>Try to arrange your schedule so you are not in “sleep debt” before a long trip. Your body gets used to sleeping during certain hours. If you are driving during those hours, you will be less alert. If possible, try to schedule trips for the hours you are normally awake. Many heavy motor vehicle accidents occur between midnight and 6 a.m.; tired drivers can easily fall asleep at these times, especially if they don\'t regularly drive at those hours. Trying to push on and finish a long trip at these times can be very dangerous.</p>\r\r<h4>Exercise Regularly</h4>\r\r<p>Resistance to fatigue and improved sleep are among the benefits of regular exercise. Try to incorporate exercise into your daily life. Instead of sitting and watching TV in your sleeper, walk or jog a few laps around the parking lot. A little bit of daily exercise will give you energy throughout the day.</p>\r\r<h4>Eat Healthy</h4>\r\r<p>It is often hard for drivers to find healthy food. But with a little extra effort, you can eat healthy, even on the road. Try to find restaurants with healthy, balanced meals. If you must eat at fast-food restaurants, pick low-fat items. Another simple way to reduce your caloric intake is to eliminate fattening snacks. Instead, try fruit or vegetables.</p>\r\r<h4>Avoid Medication</h4>\r\r<p>Many medicines can make you sleepy; those that do have a label warning against operating vehicles or machinery. The most common medicine of this type is an ordinary cold pill. If you have to drive with a cold, you are better off suffering from the cold than from the effects of the medicine.</p>\r\r<h4>Visit Your Doctor</h4>\r\r<p>Regular checkups literally can be lifesavers. Illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and skin and colon cancer can be detected easily and treated if found in time.</p>\r\r<p>You should consult your physician or a local sleep disorder center if you suffer from frequent daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, take frequent naps, fall asleep at strange times, snore loudly, gasp and choke in your sleep, and/or wake up feeling as though you have not had enough sleep.</p>\r\r<h2>While You Are Driving</h2>\r\r<h4>Keep Cool</h4>\r\r<p>A hot, poorly ventilated vehicle can make you sleepy. Keep the window or vent cracked open or use the air conditioner, if you have one.</p>\r\r<h4>Take Breaks</h4>\r\r<p>Short breaks can keep you alert. But the time to take them is before you feel really drowsy or tired. Stop often. Walk around and inspect your vehicle. It may help to do some physical exercises.</p>\r\r<p>Be sure to take a mid-afternoon break and plan to sleep between midnight and 6 a.m.</p>\r\r<h4>Recognize the Danger Signals of Drowsy Driving</h4>\r\r<p>Sleep is not voluntary. If you’re drowsy, you can fall asleep and never even know it. If you are drowsy, you are likely to have “micro sleeps”—brief naps that last around four or five seconds. At 55 miles an hour, that’s more than 100 yards, and plenty of time for a crash. Even if you are not aware of being drowsy, if you have a sleep debt you are still at risk. Here are a few ways to tell if you’re about to fall asleep. If you experience any of these danger signs, take them as a warning that you could fall asleep without meaning to.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Your eyes close or go out of focus by themselves.\r<li>You have trouble keeping your head up.\r<li>You can’t stop yawning.\r<li>You have wandering, disconnected thoughts.\r<li>You don’t remember driving the last few miles.\r<li>You drift between lanes, tailgate, or miss traffic signs.\r<li>You keep jerking the truck back into the lane.\r<li>You have drifted off the road and narrowly missed crashing.\r</ul></div>\r<p>If you have even one of these symptoms, you may be in danger of falling asleep.

	(441, 'di0032.2_16', '<h2>When You Do Become Sleepy</h2><p>When you are sleepy, trying to "push on" is far more dangerous than most drivers think. It is a major cause of fatal accidents. Here are some important rules to follow.</p>\r\r<h4>Stop to Sleep</h4>\r\r<p>When your body needs sleep, sleep is the only thing that will work. If you have to make a stop anyway, make it whenever you feel the first signs of sleepiness, even if it is earlier than you planned. By getting up a little earlier the next day, you can keep on schedule without the danger of driving while you are not alert.</p>\r\r<h4>Take a Nap</h4>\r\r<p>If you can\'t stop for the night, at least pull off at a safe place, such as a rest area or truck stop, and take a nap. A nap as short as a half-hour will do more to overcome fatigue than a half-hour coffee stop.</p>\r\r<h4>Avoid Drugs</h4>\r\r<p>There are no drugs that can overcome being tired. While they may keep you awake for a while, they won\'t make you alert. And eventually, you\'ll be even more tired than if you hadn\'t taken them at all. Sleep is the only thing that can overcome fatigue.</p>\r\r<h4>Do Not</h4>\r\r<p>Do not rely on coffee or another source of caffeine to keep you awake. Do not count on the radio, an open window, or other tricks to keep you awake.</p>\r\r<h2>Illness</h2>\r\r<p>Once in a while, you may become so ill that you cannot operate a motor vehicle safely. If this happens to you, you must not drive. However, in case of an emergency, you may drive to the nearest place where you can safely stop.</p>\r\r<h1 align="center">Hazardous Materials Rules For All Commercial Drivers</h1>\r\r<p>All drivers should know something about hazardous materials. You must be able to recognize hazardous cargo, and you must know whether or not you can haul it without having a hazardous materials endorsement on your CDL license. For more detailed information, see course {{COURSE_NUMBER_TITLE:71}}.</p>\r\r<h2>Hazardous Materials</h2>\r\r<p>Hazardous materials are products that pose a risk to health, safety, and property during transportation.</p>\r\r<h2>Hazardous Materials Rules</h2>\r\r<p>You must follow the many rules about transporting hazardous materials. The intent of these rules is to:\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>Contain the product.\r<li>Communicate the risk.\r<li>Ensure safe drivers and equipment.\r</ul></div>\r<h4>To Contain the Product</h4>\r\r<p>Many hazardous products can injure or kill on contact. To protect drivers and others from contact, the rules tell shippers how to package safely. Similar rules tell drivers how to load, transport, and unload bulk tanks. These are containment rules.</p>\r\r<h4>To Communicate the Risk</h4>\r\r<p>The shipper uses a shipping paper and diamond shaped hazard labels (Placards) to warn dockworkers and drivers of the risk.</p>\r\r<p>After an accident or hazardous material spill or leak, you may be injured and unable to communicate the hazards of the materials you are transporting. Firefighters and police can prevent or reduce the amount of damage or injury at the scene if they know what hazardous materials are being transported.

An earthquake is the sudden, rapid shaking of the earth, caused by the breaking and shifting of subterranean rock as it releases strain that has accumulated over a long time.</p>\r\r<p>For hundreds of millions of years, the forces of plate tectonics have shaped the earth, as the huge plates that form the earth’s surface slowly move over, under, and past each other. Sometimes, the movement is gradual. At other times, the plates are locked together, unable to release accumulated energy. When the accumulated energy grows strong enough, the plates break free. If the earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may cause many deaths and injuries and extensive property damage.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:666}}</p>\r\r<p>All 50 states and 5 U.S. territories are at some risk for earthquakes.  Earthquakes can happen at any time of the year. The 2011 East Coast earthquake illustrated the fact that it is impossible to predict when or where an earthquake will occur, so it is important that you and your family are prepared ahead of time.</p>\r\r<p>This course is part of a monthly safety inservice series provided to employees as a way to help control risks associated with the performance of activities that have the potential for causing harm to employees.

The {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1215}} Patient Information Sheet should be provided to your patients and their family members that live in earthquake-prone areas.</p>\r\r{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\r\r<h2>Know the Terms</h2>\r\r<p>Familiarize yourself with these terms to help identify an earthquake hazard:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<h4>Aftershock</h4>\r\r<p>An earthquake of similar or lesser intensity that follows the main earthquake.</p>\r\r<h4>Earthquake</h4>\r\r<p>A sudden slipping or movement of a portion of the earth’s crust accompanied and followed by a series of vibrations.</p>\r\r<h4>Epicenter</h4>\r\r<p>The place on the earth’s surface directly above the point on the fault where the earthquake rupture began. Once fault slippage begins, it expands along the fault during the earthquake and can extend hundreds of miles before stopping.</p>\r\r<h4>Fault</h4>\r\r<p>The fracture across which displacement has occurred during an earthquake. The slippage may range from less than an inch to more than 10 yards in a severe earthquake.</p>\r\r<h4>Magnitude</h4>\r\r<p>The amount of energy released during an earthquake, which is computed from the amplitude of the seismic waves. A magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter Scale indicates an extremely strong earthquake. Each whole number on the scale represents an increase of about 30 times more energy released than the previous whole number represents. Therefore, an earthquake measuring 6.0 is about 30 times more powerful than one measuring 5.0.</p>\r\r<h4>Seismic Hazards</h4>\r\r<p>Sources of potential harm or loss during earthquakes. They can be natural phenomena, such as landslides or tsunamis that are generated by earthquake ground shaking. They can also be elements of the built environment, such as vulnerable buildings, brittle piping, or loose equipment, which can become hazards when exposed to earthquake shaking.</p>\r\r<h4>Seismic Risks</h4>\r\r<p>The harm or losses that are likely to result from exposure to seismic hazards. They are usually measured in terms of expected casualties (fatalities and injuries), direct economic losses (repair and replacement costs), and indirect economic losses (income lost during downtime resulting from damage to private property or public infrastructure). Other, more specific measures of risk are also used for disaster planning, such as probable volumes and durations of utility outages and displaced households, and amounts of debris likely to be generated.</p>\r\r<h4>Seismic Waves</h4>\r\r<p>Vibrations that travel outward from the earthquake fault at speeds of several miles per second. Although fault slippage directly under a structure can cause considerable damage, the vibrations of seismic waves cause most of the destruction during earthquakes.</p>\r\r<h4>Exposure</h4>\r\r<p>The number of people present in stricken areas limits earthquake casualties, and losses are constrained by the quantity and value of the buildings, infrastructure, and other property in those areas. Seismic risk increases as earthquake-prone regions become more densely populated and urbanized. Although local planning and zoning activities can help shape regional growth over time, additional development is generally (and understandably) promoted as a means of strengthening local economies.</p>\r\r<h4>Vulnerability</h4>\r\r<p>The vulnerability of property to seismic hazards is determined by the prevalence of earthquake-resistant construction. Buildings, lifelines, and other elements of the built environment that have been constructed in compliance with the latest seismic building codes and standards will be more resistant to earthquake damage. Older structures that were built under earlier, less-effective codes and have not been retrofitted to meet later standards are likely to sustain more damage. Building Codes further explains this critical factor.</p>\r\r<p>Levels of earthquake preparedness and disaster resilience determine how vulnerable people are to seismic hazards. Individuals, organizations, and communities that have invested in assessing their risks and in formulating and implementing responsible preparedness and mitigation measures are likely to experience fewer casualties, less damage, and less disruption from earthquakes. Earthquake-resistant construction is a preeminent example of such measures.</p></div>', 1, 317, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(445, 'ms0128_02', '<h2>The Richter Magnitude Scale</h2><p>Seismic waves are the vibrations from earthquakes that travel through the Earth; they are recorded on instruments called seismographs. Seismographs record a zigzag trace that shows the varying amplitude of ground oscillations beneath the instrument. Sensitive seismographs, which greatly magnify these ground motions, can detect strong earthquakes from sources anywhere in the world. The time, locations, and magnitude of an earthquake can be determined from the data recorded by seismograph stations.</p>\r\r<p>The Richter magnitude scale was developed in 1935 by Charles F. Richter of the California Institute of Technology as a mathematical device to compare the size of earthquakes. The magnitude of an earthquake is determined from the logarithm of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs. Adjustments are included for the variation in the distance between the various seismographs and the epicenter of the earthquakes. On the Richter Scale, magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions. For example, a magnitude 5.3 might be computed for a moderate earthquake, and a strong earthquake might be rated as magnitude 6.3. Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude; as an estimate of energy, each whole number step in the magnitude scale corresponds to the release of about 30 times more energy than the amount associated with the preceding whole number value.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:667}}</p>\r\r<p>At first, the Richter Scale could be applied only to the records from instruments of identical manufacture. Now, instruments are carefully calibrated with respect to each other. Thus, magnitude can be computed from the record of any calibrated seismograph.</p>\r\r<p>Earthquakes with magnitude of about 2.0 or less are usually called microearthquakes; they are not commonly felt by people and are generally recorded only on local seismographs. Events with magnitudes of about 4.5 or greater—there are several thousand such shocks annually—are strong enough to be recorded by sensitive seismographs all over the world. Great earthquakes, such as the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska, have magnitudes of 8.0 or higher. On the average, one earthquake of such size occurs somewhere in the world each year. The Richter Scale has no upper limit. Recently, another scale called the moment magnitude scale has been devised for more precise study of great earthquakes.</p>\r\r<p>The Richter Scale is not used to express damage. An earthquake in a densely populated area which results in many deaths and considerable damage may have the same magnitude as a shock in a remote area that does nothing more than frighten the wildlife. Humans may not even feel large-magnitude earthquakes that occur beneath the oceans.</p>', 2, 181, 1, NULL, NULL),

Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.\r<li>Listen to a battery-operated radio or television for the latest emergency information.\r<li>Be aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas. These are also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called "tidal waves"). When local authorities issue a tsunami warning, assume that a series of dangerous waves is on the way. Stay away from the beach.\r<li>Use the telephone only for emergency calls.\r<li>Go to a designated public shelter if your home had been damaged and is no longer safe. Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter in your area (example: shelter 12345).\r<li>Stay away from damaged areas. Stay away unless police, fire, or relief organizations have specifically requested your assistance. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.\r<li>Be careful when driving after an earthquake and anticipate traffic light outages.\r<li>After it is determined that it’s safe to return, your safety should be your primary priority as you begin clean up and recovery.\r<li>Open cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.\r<li>Find out how to keep food safe during and after an emergency by visiting: http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/emergency/index.html\r<li>Put on long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, sturdy shoes, and work gloves to protect against injury from broken objects.\r<li>Clean up spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately. Leave the area if you smell gas or fumes from other chemicals.\r<li>Inspect the entire length of chimneys for damage. Unnoticed damage could lead to a fire.\r<li>Inspect utilities.\n	<ul>\r<li>Check for gas leaks. If you smell gas or hear blowing or hissing noises, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor\'s home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, a professional must turn it back on.\r<li>Look for electrical system damage. If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice.\r<li>Check for sewage and water lines damage. If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes.\r</ul></ul></div>\r\r<h1>Summary</h1>\r\r<p>Now that you have read this course you should be more informed about earthquakes and the activities you can perform before, during, and after an earthquake that can help keep you, your family, and your patients safe.

Infection prevention and control demands a basic understanding of the epidemiology of diseases; risk factors that increase patient susceptibility to infection; and the practices, procedures and treatments that may result in infections.</p>\r\r<p>Infection control is the discipline concerned with preventing nosocomial or healthcare-associated infection (HAI), a practical sub-discipline of epidemiology. It is an essential part of the infrastructure of health care. Infection control and healthcare epidemiology are akin to public health practice, practiced within the confines of a particular healthcare delivery system rather than directed at society as a whole.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:490}}</p>\r\r<p>Infection control addresses factors related to the spread of infections within the healthcare setting (whether patient-to-patient, from patients to staff and from staff to patients, or among staff), including prevention (via hand hygiene/hand washing, cleaning/disinfection/sterilization, vaccination, surveillance), monitoring/investigation of demonstrated or suspected spread of infection within a particular health-care setting (surveillance and outbreak investigation), and management (interruption of outbreaks).

	(451, 'oc0140.1_02', '<h2>Infectious Disease Process</h2><p>In order for infection and disease to occur in an individual, a process involving six related components must occur. This process has been referred to as the “Chain of Infection.” In this section we will examine each of these links and some other important concepts that help us understand infectious disease transmission. To stop the spread of disease, one or more of these links must be broken.</p>\r\r<h3>Etiologic Agents</h3>\r\r<p>There are seven categories of biological agents that can cause infectious diseases. Each has its own particular characteristics.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ol>\r<li>Metazoa\r<li>Protozoa\r<li>Fungi\r<li>Bacteria\r<li>Rickettsia\r<li>Viruses\r<li>Prions\r</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Reservoir</h3><p>The reservoir is the usual habitat in which the agent lives and multiplies. Depending on the agent, the reservoir may be:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\n<ul>\r<li>Human\n<ul>\r<li>Acute Clinical Cases\r<li>Carriers\n</ul>\r<li>Animal\r<li>Environmental\r</ul>\n</div>\r<p>When working with any disease agent, it is important to learn about its usual reservoir(s).</p>\n\n<h3>Portal of Exit</h3><p>The portal of exit is the route by which the disease agent may escape from the human or animal reservoir. While many disease agents have only one portal of exit, others may leave by various portals. The portals most commonly associated with human and animal diseases are:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>Respiratory \r<li>Genitourinary\r<li>Alimentary\r<li>Skin\r<li>Transplacental\r</ul>\n</div>\r<p><b>Respiratory</b></p>\r\r<p>This is the route of many disease agents that cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, influenza, and tuberculosis. It is also the route used by many childhood vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b and pneumococcal disease. The respiratory portal of exit is the most important and the most difficult to control.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:499}}</p>\r\r<p><b>Genitourinary</b></p>\r\r<p>This portal of exit is the route of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and HIV. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, and leptospirosis, a bacterial infection, are both spread through urine released into the environment.</p>\r\r<p><b>Alimentary</b></p>\r\r<p>The alimentary portal of exit may be the mouth, as in rabies and other diseases transmitted by bites. More commonly, the other end of the intestinal tract spreads disease agents. These are referred to as enteric diseases. In general, enteric diseases may be controlled through good hygiene, proper food preparation and sanitary sewage disposal. Examples include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Hepatitis A\r<li><i>Salmonella</i>, including typhoid\r<li><i>Shigella</i>\r<li>Cholera\r<li><i>Giardia</i>\r<li><i>Campylobacter</i>\r</ul></div>\r<p><b>Skin</b></p>\r\r<p>Skin may serve as a portal of exit through superficial lesions or through percutaneous penetration. Superficial skin lesions that produce infectious discharges are found in smallpox, varicella (chickenpox), syphilis, chancroid, and impetigo. Percutaneous exit occurs through mosquito bites (malaria, West Nile virus) or through the use of needles (hepatitis B, C & HIV).</p>\r\r<p><b>Transplacental</b></p>\r\r<p>This portal of exit from mother to fetus is important in the transmission of rubella, HIV, syphilis, and cytomegalovirus (the most common infectious cause of developmental disabilities). It is, fortunately, not a factor for most diseases.</p>', 2, 240, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(452, 'oc0140.1_03', '<h3>Mode of Transmission</h3><p>A mode of transmission is necessary to bridge the gap between the portal of exit from the reservoir and the portal of entry into the host. The two basic modes are direct and indirect.</p>\r\r<p><b>Direct Transmission</b></p>\r\r<p>Direct transmission occurs more or less immediately. Many diseases are transmitted by direct contact with the human, animal, or environmental reservoir. Prime examples are sexually transmitted diseases and enteric diseases such as <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, and <i>Campylobacter</i>. Contact with soil may lead to mycotic (fungal) diseases.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:672}}</p>\r\r<p>Droplet spread is also considered direct transmission. Infectious aerosols produced by coughing or sneezing can transmit infection directly to susceptible people up to three feet away. Many respiratory diseases are spread this way.</p>\r\r<p><b>Indirect Transmission</b></p>\r\r<p>Animate mechanisms involve vectors. Flies may transmit infectious agents such as <i>Shigella</i> by walking on feces and then on food. Mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas may serve as reservoirs for the growth and multiplication of agents, for example in malaria or Lyme disease.</p>\r\r<p>Inanimate mechanisms spread disease through environmental vehicles or by air. Anything may be a vehicle, including objects, food, water, milk, or biological products.</p>\r\r<p><b>Indirect Airborne Transmission</b></p>\r\r<p>Indirect, airborne transmission is important in some respiratory diseases. This occurs when very tiny particles of respiratory material become suspended in the air (called aerosols). Such particles may remain suspended and stay infectious for varying periods of time. They are particularly dangerous because their size (1 to 5 microns) allows them to be drawn deep into the lungs and retained. Tuberculosis is spread this way, as is measles in certain settings such as doctors\' offices. Air may also spread particles of various sizes from contaminated soil, or from objects such as clothing and floors.</p>\r\r<h3>Portal of Entry</h3>\r\r<p>The portal of entry into the host is usually the same as the portal of exit from the reservoir. In some diseases, however, the exit and entry portals may differ. For example, staphylococcal bacteria may escape from one person’s respiratory tract to infect another person’s skin lesion. If that person is a food handler, the staphylococcal bacteria may escape from the infected skin lesion, contaminate food where it can incubate, and cause food poisoning in people eating the food.</p>', 3, 163, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(453, 'oc0140.1_04', '<h3>Susceptible Host</h3><p>The last essential component in the chain of infection is the susceptible host. Susceptibility is affected by:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Genetic factors\r<li>General resistance factors\r<li>Specific acquired immunity\r</ul>\n</div>\r<p><b>Genetic Factors</b></p>\r\r<p>The role of genetic factors in susceptibility to infectious diseases is not yet well understood. Genes do seem to play a role in the progression of HIV disease, and perhaps in individuals’ susceptibility to meningococcal meningitis.</p>\r\r<p><b>General Resistance Factors</b></p>\r\r<p>General resistance factors include many body functions that we take for granted. Intact skin and mucous membranes help us resist disease. So do the gastric acid in our stomachs, the cilia in our respiratory tracts, and the cough reflex.</p>\r\r<p><b>Specific Acquired Immunity</b></p>\r\r<p>Specific acquired immunity is the greatest influence on host susceptibility, and it may be acquired naturally or artificially.</p>\r\r<p><i>Active natural immunity</i> may be acquired by experiencing an infection. Many diseases confer immunity after a single infection, but many others do not. A single bout of measles or chickenpox, for example, confers lifelong immunity to that disease. Influenza and salmonella are examples of infections that do not confer immunity and therefore may recur.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:500}}</p>\r\r<p><i>Passive natural immunity</i> is the transfer of antibodies from the mother to the newborn child, via the placenta and/or breast milk. It diminishes after varying lengths of time and is very important in giving infants a good head start in life.</p>\r\r<p><b>Artificial Immunity</b></p>\r\r<p><i>Active immunity</i> is obtained by receiving a vaccine or toxoid, which stimulates “active” immunity since the recipient responds by producing his/her own antibodies.</p>\r\r<p><i>Passive immunity</i> is obtained by receiving an antitoxin or immune globulin that confers “passive” immunity, essentially by borrowing the antibodies of other people.</p>\r\r<p>Passive immunity lasts for only a short time, while active immunity usually lasts much longer, even for a lifetime.</p>', 4, 136, 1, NULL, NULL),

There are two tiers of HICPAC/CDC precautions to prevent transmission of infectious agents, Standard Precautions and Transmission-Based Precautions. Policies and procedures that explain how Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are applied, including systems used to identify and communicate information about patients with potentially transmissible infectious agents, are essential to ensure the success of these measures.</p>\r\r<h3>Standard Precautions</h3>\r\r<p>Standard Precautions are intended to be applied to the care of all patients in all healthcare settings, regardless of the suspected or confirmed presence of an infectious agent. Implementation of Standard Precautions constitutes the primary strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated transmission of infectious agents among patients and healthcare personnel.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:503}}</p>\r\r<p>Standard Precautions combine the major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation and are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include a group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. These include: hand hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g. wear gloves for direct contact, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient).</p>\r\r<p>The application of Standard Precautions during patient care is determined by the nature of the healthcare worker-patient interaction and the extent of anticipated blood, body fluid, or pathogen exposure. For some interactions, only gloves may be needed; during other interactions, use of gloves, gown, and face shield or mask and goggles is necessary.</p>\r\r<p>Standard Precautions are also intended to protect patients by ensuring that healthcare personnel do not carry infectious agents to patients on their hands or via equipment used during patient care.</p>\r\r<p>Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette, safe injection practices, and use of masks for insertion of catheters or injection of material into spinal or epidural spaces via lumbar puncture procedures have been added to Standard Precautions. While most elements of Standard Precautions evolved from Universal Precautions that were developed for protection of healthcare personnel, these new elements of Standard Precautions focus on protection of patients.</p>\r\r<p><b>Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette</b></p>\r\r<p>This precaution is targeted at patients and accompanying family members and friends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections, and applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering a healthcare facility. The term cough etiquette is derived from recommended source control measures for <i>M. tuberculosis</i>.</p>\r\r<p>The elements of Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ol>\r<li>Education of healthcare facility staff, patients, and visitors;\r<li>Posted signs, in language(s) appropriate to the population served, with instructions to patients and accompanying family members or friends; \r<li>Source control measures (e.g., covering the mouth/nose with a tissue when coughing and prompt disposal of used tissues, using surgical masks on the coughing person when tolerated and appropriate);\r<li>Hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions; and \r<li>Spatial separation, ideally >3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible.\r</ol></div>\r<p>Covering sneezes and coughs and placing masks on coughing patients are proven means of source containment that prevent infected persons from dispersing respiratory secretions into the air.</p>\r\r<p>Healthcare personnel are advised to observe Droplet Precautions (i.e., wear a mask) and hand hygiene when examining and caring for patients with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection. Healthcare personnel who have a respiratory infection are advised to avoid direct patient contact, especially with high-risk patients. If this is not possible, then a mask should be worn while providing patient care.</p>\r\r<p><b>Safe Injection Practices</b></p>\r\r<p>The investigation of four large outbreaks of HBV and HCV among patients in ambulatory care facilities in the United States identified a need to define and reinforce safe injection practices. The primary breaches in infection control practice that contributed to these outbreaks were:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>Reinsertion of used needles into a multiple-dose vial or solution container (e.g., saline bag)\r<li>Use of a single needle/syringe to administer intravenous medication to multiple patients\r</ol></div>\r<p>These and other outbreaks of viral hepatitis could have been prevented by adherence to basic principles of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications. These include the use of a sterile, single-use, disposable needle and syringe for each injection given and prevention of contamination of injection equipment and medication. Whenever possible, use of single-dose vials is preferred over multiple-dose vials, especially when medications will be administered to multiple patients.</p>\r\r<p>Outbreaks related to unsafe injection practices indicate that some healthcare personnel are unaware of, do not understand, or do not adhere to basic principles of infection control and aseptic technique. To ensure that all healthcare workers understand and adhere to recommended practices, principles of infection control and aseptic technique need to be reinforced in training programs and incorporated into institutional policies that are monitored for adherence.</p>\r\r<p><b>Special Lumbar Puncture Procedures</b></p>\r\r<p>In 2004, the CDC investigated eight cases of post-myelography meningitis that either were reported to the CDC or identified through a survey of the Emerging Infections Network of the Infectious Disease Society of America. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of all eight cases yielded streptococcal species consistent with oropharyngeal flora and there were changes in the CSF and clinical status indicative of bacterial meningitis. Equipment and products used during these procedures (e.g., contrast media) were excluded as probable sources of contamination. Procedural details available for seven cases determined that antiseptic skin preparations and sterile gloves had been used. However, none of the clinicians wore a facemask, giving rise to the speculation that droplet transmission of oropharyngeal flora was the most likely explanation for these infections. In October 2005, the HICPAC reviewed the evidence and concluded that there is sufficient experience to warrant the additional protection of a facemask for the individual placing a catheter or injecting material into the spinal or epidural space.</p>', 7, 598, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(457, 'oc0140.1_08', '<h3>Transmission-Based Precautions</h3><p>Transmission-Based Precautions are for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infectious agents, including certain epidemiologically important pathogens, which require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission. Since the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a healthcare facility, Transmission-Based Precautions are used empirically, according to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time, and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible infectious etiology is ruled out.</p>\r\r<p>There are three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions: Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Airborne Precautions. Transmission-Based Precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission is (are) not completely interrupted using Standard Precautions alone. For some diseases that have multiple routes of transmission (e.g., SARS), more than one Transmission-Based Precautions category may be used. When used either singly or in combination, they are always used in addition to Standard Precautions.</p>\r\r<p><b>Contact Precautions</b></p>\r\r<p>Contact Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important microorganisms, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient’s environment. Contact\rPrecautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:504}}</p>\r\r<p>A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options. In multi-patient rooms, >3 feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients.</p>\r\r<p>Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Contact Precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient’s environment. Donning PPE upon room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (e.g., VRE, <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens; RSV).</p>\r\r<p><b>Droplet Precautions</b></p>\r\r<p>Droplet Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:505}}</p>\r\r<p>A single patient room is preferred for patients who require Droplet Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options. Spatial separation of >3 feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patients; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on Droplet Precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.</p>\r\r<p><b>Airborne Precautions</b></p>\r\r<p>Airborne Precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus, varicella virus, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and possibly SARS-CoV). The preferred placement for patients who require Airborne Precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:506}}</p>\r\r<p>A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit-testing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate.</p>\r\r<p>Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Airborne Precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations, which are donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune healthcare workers should <u>not</u> care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox).</p>', 8, 348, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(458, 'oc0140.1_09', '<h3>Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions</h3><p>Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect for limited periods of time (i.e., while the risk for transmission of the infectious agent persists or for the duration of the illness). For most infectious diseases, this duration reflects known patterns of persistence and shedding of infectious agents associated with the natural history of the infectious process and its treatment. For some diseases (e.g., pharyngeal or cutaneous diphtheria, RSV), Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases, (e.g., <i>M. tuberculosis</i>) state laws and regulations, and healthcare facility policies, may dictate the duration of precautions. In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks.</p>\r\r<h3>Engineering Controls</h3>\r\r<p>Engineering Controls means controls (e.g., sharps disposal containers, self-sheathing needles, safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems) that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:507}}</p>\r\r<p>Examples of engineering controls used at {{LOCATION:NAME}} include:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Providing handwashing facilities that are readily accessible to employees; when provision of handwashing facilities is not feasible, {{LOCATION:NAME}} will provide either an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes.

	(466, 'oc0510.2_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Respirators are devices that protect employees from inhaling harmful substances, including chemical, biological, and radiological agents. These substances can be in the form of airborne vapors, gases, dust, fogs, fumes, mists, smokes, or sprays. Some respirators also ensure that employees do not breathe air that contains dangerously low levels of oxygen or that is otherwise immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH), (e.g., life-threatening exposures during interior structural firefighting.) Respirators may be used to provide protection during routine operations where engineering controls and work practice controls are not able to provide sufficient protection from these hazards, or in emergencies.</p>\r\r<p>In situations in which employees are exposed to harmful airborne hazards, respirators must “seal off” and isolate the user’s respiratory system from the contaminated environment. The risk that a user will experience an adverse health outcome when relying on respiratory protection is a function of the toxicity or hazardous nature of the air contaminants present, the concentrations of the contaminants in the air, the duration of exposure, and the degree of isolation provided by the respirator. When respirators fail or do not provide the degree of protection expected by the user, the user is placed at an increased risk of any adverse health effects that are associated with exposure to the respiratory hazards present. Furthermore, the margin for error in IDLH atmospheres is slight or nonexistent because an equipment malfunction or employee mistake can, without warning, expose the employee to an atmosphere incapable of supporting human life. Such exposure may disable the employee and require an immediate rescue if the employee’s life is to be saved. Therefore, it is critical that respirators are properly selected and used in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134).</p>\r\r<p>Respirators provide protection from respiratory hazards only when they are properly selected and used in compliance with a Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 and 29 CFR 1926.103). The final Respiratory Protection standard applies to general industry, construction, longshoring, shipyard, and marine terminal workplaces.</p>\r\r<h1>Regulations</h1>\r\r<p>The Respiratory Protection standard requires employers to establish and maintain a written respiratory protection program to protect their respirator-wearing employees. OSHA revised the original 1971 Respiratory Protection standard in 1998. The new standard incorporates scientific principles and technologies that had emerged since 1971. Due to advances in technology, many areas covered by the previous standard had become outdated.</p>\r\r<p>The final revision of the Respiratory Protection standard is intended to:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Enhance the protection of employee health.\r<li>Promote more effective use of respirators.\r<li>Make it easier for you to comply with its provisions.\r<li>Make it easier to understand the policy and procedures you must follow when implementing a respiratory protection program.\r<li>Supersede most respiratory provisions in existing standard.\r</ul></div>\r<h2>The Respiratory Protection Program</h2>\r\r<p>A respiratory protection program is a cohesive collection of <i>written</i> worksite-specific procedures and policies that, utilized together, address all respiratory protection elements required by the standard. {{LOCATIONS:NAME}} policies/program must be evaluated for effectiveness on a regular basis.</p>\r\r<p>When respirators are used during operations where exposures exceed OSHA’s permissible exposure limit (PEL), use of properly functioning respirators is essential to ensure that employees are not placed at significant risk of material impairment of health. Respiratory protection is necessary in situations where engineering and administrative controls are insufficient to reduce airborne hazards, in emergencies, in situations in which engineering and other controls are being installed or maintained, in oxygen deficient atmospheres, or for internal structural firefighting. The final Respiratory Protection standard establishes the minimum elements of a comprehensive program that are necessary to ensure effective performance of a respirator.</p>\r\r<p>{{LOCATION:NAME}} must designate a respiratory program administrator who is qualified by appropriate training or experience and that is commensurate with the complexity of the program, in order to administer or oversee the respiratory protection program and conduct the required evaluations of program effectiveness. <!-- At {{LOCATION:NAME}} the respiratory program administrator is <b>{{OFFICIAL_TYPE_FULL_NAME:10}}</b>, <b>{{OFFICIAL_TYPE_JOBTITLE:10}}</b> at <b>{{OFFICIAL_TYPE_PHONE:10}}</b> or via email at <b>{{OFFICIAL_TYPE_EMAIL:10}}</b>.--></p>\r\r<p>At {{LOCATION:NAME}}, contact any of the following people pertaining to the respiratory program administrator:</p>\r<ul>\r<li><b>Janice Placid</b>, <b>Respiratory Protection Administrator</b> by phone at <b>503-233-4242</b> or email at <b>j_placid@mail.com</b>.\r<li><b>Glenda Vancouver</b>, <b>Infection Control Nurse</b> by phone at <b>503-233-4200</b> or email at <b>g_vancouver@mail.com</b>.\r</ul>\r<p>This course will cover the training requirements detailed in the Respiratory Protection Standard.

The MUC can be determined mathematically by multiplying the assigned protection factor specified for a respirator by the required OSHA permissible exposure limit, short-term exposure limit, or ceiling limit. When no OSHA exposure limit is available for a hazardous substance, an employer must determine an MUC on the basis of relevant available information and informed professional judgment.</p>\r\r<p><b>Negative pressure respirator (tight fitting)</b> is a respirator in which the air pressure inside the facepiece is negative during inhalation with respect to the ambient air pressure outside the respirator.</p>\r\r<p><b>Oxygen deficient atmosphere</b> is an atmosphere with an oxygen content below 19.5% by volume.</p>\r\r<p><b>Physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP)</b> is an individual whose legally permitted scope of practice (i.e., license, registration, or certification) allows him or her to independently provide, or be delegated the responsibility to provide, some or all of the health care services required by paragraph (e) of this section.</p>\r\r<p><b>Positive pressure respirator</b> is a respirator in which the pressure inside the respiratory inlet covering exceeds the ambient air pressure outside the respirator.</p>\r\r<p><b>Powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR)</b> is an air-purifying respirator that uses a blower to force the ambient air through air-purifying elements to the inlet covering.</p>\r\r<p><b>Qualitative fit test (QLFT)</b> is a pass/fail fit test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individual\'s response to the test agent.</p>\r\r<p><b>Quantitative fit test (QNFT)</b> is an assessment of the adequacy of respirator fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator.</p>\r\r<p><b>Respiratory inlet covering</b> means that portion of a respirator that forms the protective barrier between the user\'s respiratory tract and an air-purifying device or breathing air source, or both.

Perhaps now more than ever before, job stress poses a threat to the health of workers and, in turn, to home healthcare organizations. Through its research program in job stress and through educational materials such as this course, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are committed to providing organizations with knowledge to reduce this threat.</p>\r\r<p>Work stress is thought to affect individuals’ psychological and physical health, as well as organizational effectiveness, in an adverse manner. This course provides practical advice on how to deal with work stress. It is intended that employers, managers, and employees use this course as part of an initiative to educate on the management of work stress. Discussed are the nature of stress at work, the causes and effects of stress, as well as prevention strategies, risk assessment, and management methods. Also discussed is the role of the organizational culture in this process and the resources to be drawn upon for managing work stress.</p>\r\r{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\r\r<h2>Stress in Today\'s Workplace</h2>\r\r<p>The longer he waited, the more David worried. For weeks he had been plagued by aching muscles, loss of appetite, restless sleep, and a complete sense of exhaustion. At first he tried to ignore these problems, but eventually he became so short-tempered and irritable that his wife insisted he get a checkup. Now, sitting in the doctor\'s office and wondering what the verdict would be, he didn\'t even notice when Theresa took the seat beside him. They had been good friends when she worked in the front office at the plant, but he hadn\'t seen her since she left three years ago to take a job as a customer service representative. Her gentle poke in the ribs brought him around, and within minutes they were talking and gossiping as if she had never left.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:673}}</p>\r\r<p>"You got out just in time," he told her. "Since the reorganization, nobody feels safe. It used to be that as long as you did your work, you had a job. That\'s not for sure anymore. They expect the same production rates even though two guys are now doing the work of three. We\'re so backed up I\'m working twelve-hour shifts six days a week. I swear I hear those machines humming in my sleep. Guys are calling in sick just to get a break. Morale is so bad they\'re talking about bringing in some consultants to figure out a better way to get the job done."</p>\r\r<p>"Well, I really miss you guys," she said. "I\'m afraid I jumped from the frying pan into the fire. In my new job, the computer routes the calls and they never stop. I even have to schedule my bathroom breaks. All I hear the whole day are complaints from unhappy customers. I try to be helpful and sympathetic, but I can\'t promise anything without getting my boss\'s approval. Most of the time I\'m caught between what the customer wants and company policy. I\'m not sure whom I\'m supposed to keep happy. The other reps are so uptight and tense they don\'t even talk to one another. We all go to our own little cubicles and stay there until quitting time. To make matters worse, my mother\'s health is deteriorating. If only I could use some of my sick time to look after her. No wonder I\'m in here with migraine headaches and high blood pressure. A lot of the reps are seeing the employee assistance counselor and taking stress management classes, which seems to help. But sooner or later, someone will have to make some changes in the way the place is run."</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:674}}</p>\r\r<h2>Scope of Stress in the American Workplace</h2>\r\r<p>David\'s and Theresa\'s stories are unfortunate, but not unusual. Job stress has become a common and costly problem in the American workplace, leaving few workers untouched. For example, studies report the following:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue"><ul>\r<li>One-fourth of employees view their jobs as the number one stressor in their lives.<sup>1</sup>\r<li>Three-fourths of employees believe the worker has more on-the-job stress than a generation ago.<sup>2</sup>\r<li>Problems at work are more strongly associated with health complaints than are any other life stressor-more so than even financial problems or family problems.<sup>3</sup>\r</ul></div>\r<p>Fortunately, research on job stress has greatly expanded in recent years. But in spite of this attention, confusion remains about the causes, effects, and prevention of job stress. This course (and video) summarizes what is known about job stress and what can be done about it.</p>\r\r<h2>Job Stress</h2>\r\r<p>Job stress can be defined as <i>the harmful physical and emotional responses that occur when the requirements of the job do not match the capabilities, resources, or needs of the worker</i>. Job stress can lead to poor health and even injury.</p>\r\r<p>The concept of <i>job stress</i> is often confused with <i>job challenge</i>, but these concepts are not the same. Challenge energizes us psychologically and physically, and it motivates us to learn new skills and master our jobs. When a challenge is met, we feel relaxed and satisfied. Thus, challenge is an important ingredient for healthy and productive work. The importance of challenge in our work lives is probably what people are referring to when they say "a little bit of stress is good for you.”</p>\r\r<p>But for David and Theresa, the situation is different—the challenge has turned into job demands that cannot be met, relaxation has turned to exhaustion, and a sense of satisfaction has turned into feelings of stress. In short, the stage is set for illness, injury, and job failure.</p>\n\n<div class="footnote footnote-gray"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><p><sup>1</sup> Northwestern National Life<br><sup>2</sup> Princeton Survey Research Associates<br><sup>3</sup> St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co.</p></div>', 1, 390, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(480, 'hr0100_02', '<h2>Causes of Job Stress</h2><p>Nearly everyone agrees that job stress results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work. Views differ, however, on the importance of <i>worker characteristics</i> versus <i>working conditions</i> as the primary cause of job stress. These differing viewpoints are important because they suggest different ways to prevent stress at work.<p>\r\r<p>According to one school of thought, differences in individual characteristics such as personality and coping style are most important in predicting whether certain job conditions will result in stress—in other words, what is stressful for one person may not be a problem for someone else. This viewpoint leads to prevention strategies that focus on workers and ways to help them cope with demanding job conditions.</p>\r\r<p>Although the importance of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people. The excessive workload demands and conflicting expectations described in David\'s and Theresa\'s stories are good examples. Such evidence argues for a greater emphasis on <i>working conditions</i> as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy.</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\n                <p>In 1960, a Michigan court upheld a compensation claim by an automotive assembly line worker who had difficulty keeping up with the pressures of the production line. To avoid falling behind, he tried to work on several assemblies at the same time and often got parts mixed up. As a result, he was subjected to repeated criticism from the foreman. Eventually he suffered a psychological breakdown.</p></div>\n\n<div class="callout callout-yellow">\n                <p>By 1995, nearly one-half of the States allowed worker compensation claims for emotional disorders and disability due to stress on the job [note, however, that courts are reluctant to uphold claims for what can be considered ordinary working conditions or just hard work].</p><p>—1995 Workers Compensation Yearbook</p></div>\n\r<h2>NIOSH Approach to Job Stress</h2>\r\r<p>On the basis of experience and research, NIOSH favors the view that working conditions play a primary role in causing job stress. However, the role of individual factors is not ignored. According to the NIOSH view, exposure to stressful working conditions (called job stressors) can have a direct influence on worker safety and health. But as shown below, individual and other situational factors can intervene to strengthen or weaken this influence. Theresa\'s need to care for her ill mother is an increasingly common example of an individual or situational factor that may intensify the effects of stressful working conditions. Examples of individual and situational factors that can help to reduce the effects of stressful working conditions include the following:</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:675}}</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Balance between work and family or personal life\r<li>A support network of friends and coworkers\r<li>A relaxed and positive outlook\n</ul></div>', 2, 184, 1, NULL, NULL),

These early signs of job stress are usually easy to recognize. But the effects of job stress on chronic diseases are more difficult to see because chronic diseases take a long time to develop and can be influenced by many factors other than stress.

The first is to develop drugs to fight the disease and to prevent or treat its complications, especially postherpetic neuralgia. The second is to understand the disease well enough to prevent it, especially in people at high risk.

Although national, state, and local efforts have begun to show encouraging results, the problem of alcohol and other drug abuse remains a serious problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that there were almost 29,000 unintentional drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2009. No workplace is immune. According to the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 74.9 percent of all adult illicit drug users are employed full or part time. Most binge and heavy alcohol users are also employed full or part time.</p>\r\r<p>Illicit drug use in America has been increasing. In 2011, an estimated 22.5 million Americans aged 12 or older—or 8.7 percent of the population—had used an illicit drug or abused a psychotherapeutic medication (such as a pain reliever, stimulant, or tranquilizer) in the past month. This is up from 8.3 percent in 2002. The increase mostly reflects a recent rise in the use of marijuana, the most commonly used illicit drug.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:473}}</p>\r\r<p>Substance abusing employees often do not make good employees.

	(489, 'oc0620.3_05', '<h2>Understanding Drug Abuse</h2><p>Many people do not understand why or how other people become addicted to drugs. It is often mistakenly assumed that drug abusers lack moral principles or willpower and that they could stop using drugs simply by choosing to change their behavior. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting takes more than good intentions or a strong will. In fact, because drugs change the brain in ways that foster compulsive drug abuse, quitting is difficult, even for those who are ready to do so. Through scientific advances, we know more about how drugs work in the brain than ever, and we also know that drug addiction can be successfully treated to help people stop abusing drugs and start leading productive lives.</p>\r\r<p>Drug abuse and addiction have negative economic consequences for individuals and for society. Estimates of the total overall costs of substance abuse in the United States, including productivity and health- and crime-related costs, exceed 600 billion dollars annually. This includes approximately 193 billion dollars for illicit drugs, 193 billion dollars for tobacco, and 235 billion dollars for alcohol. As staggering as these numbers are, they do not fully describe the breadth of destructive public health and safety implications of drug abuse and addiction, such as family disintegration, loss of employment, failure in school, domestic violence, and child abuse.</p>\r\r<h3>Drug Addiction</h3>\r\r<p>Addiction is a chronic, often relapsing, brain disease that causes compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences to the addicted individual and to those around him or her. Although the initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, the brain changes that occur over time challenge an addicted person’s self control and hamper his or her ability to resist intense impulses to take drugs.</p>\r\r<p>Fortunately, treatments are available to help people counter addiction’s powerful disruptive effects. Research shows that combining addiction treatment medications with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for most patients. Treatment approaches that are tailored to each patient’s drug abuse patterns and any co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and social problems can lead to sustained recovery and a life without drug abuse.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:474}}</p>\r\r<p>Similar to other chronic, relapsing diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, drug addiction can be managed successfully. And as with other chronic diseases, it is not uncommon for a person to relapse and begin abusing drugs again. Relapse, however, does not signal treatment failure—rather, it indicates that treatment should be reinstated, adjusted, or that an alternative treatment is needed to help the individual regain control and recover.</p>', 5, 179, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(490, 'oc0620.3_06', '<h3>Physiology</h3><p>Drugs contain chemicals that tap into the brain’s communication system and disrupt the way nerve cells normally send, receive, and process information. There are at least two ways that drugs cause this disruption: (1) by imitating the brain’s natural chemical messengers and (2) by overstimulating the “reward circuit” of the brain.</p>\r\r<p>Some drugs (e.g., marijuana and heroin) have a similar structure to chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, which are naturally produced by the brain. This similarity allows the drugs to “fool” the brain’s receptors and activate nerve cells to send abnormal messages.</p>\r\r<p>Other drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine, can cause the nerve cells to release abnormally large amounts of natural neurotransmitters (mainly dopamine) or to prevent the normal recycling of these brain chemicals, which is needed to shut off the signaling between neurons. The result is a brain awash in dopamine, a neurotransmitter present in brain regions that control movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. The overstimulation of this reward system, which normally responds to natural behaviors linked to survival (eating, spending time with loved ones, etc.), produces euphoric effects in response to psychoactive drugs. This reaction sets in motion a reinforcing pattern that “teaches” people to repeat the rewarding behavior of abusing drugs.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:475}}</p> \r\r<p>As a person continues to abuse drugs, the brain adapts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine by producing less dopamine or by reducing the number of dopamine receptors in the reward circuit. The result is a lessening of dopamine’s impact on the reward circuit, which reduces the abuser’s ability to enjoy not only the drugs but also other events in life that previously brought pleasure. This decrease compels the addicted person to keep abusing drugs in an attempt to bring the dopamine function back to normal, but now larger amounts of the drug are required to achieve the same dopamine high—an effect known as tolerance.</p>\r\r<p>Long-term abuse causes changes in other brain chemical systems and circuits as well. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that influences the reward circuit and the ability to learn. When the optimal concentration of glutamate is altered by drug abuse, the brain attempts to compensate, which can impair cognitive function. Brain imaging studies of drug-addicted individuals show changes in areas of the brain that are critical to judgment, decision making, learning and memory, and behavior control. Together, these changes can drive an abuser to seek out and take drugs compulsively despite adverse, even devastating consequences—that is the nature of addiction.</p>', 6, 170, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(491, 'oc0620.3_07', '<h3>Addiction</h3><p>No single factor can predict whether a person will become addicted to drugs. Risk for addiction is influenced by a combination of factors that include individual biology, social environment, and age or stage of development. The more risk factors an individual has, the greater the chance that taking drugs can lead to addiction. For example:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<p><b>Biology:</b> The genes that people are born with—in combination with environmental influences—account for about half of their addiction vulnerability. Additionally, gender, ethnicity, and the presence of other mental disorders may influence risk for drug abuse and addiction.</p>\r\r<p><b>Environment:</b> A person’s environment includes many different influences, from family and friends to socioeconomic status and quality of life in general. Factors such as peer pressure, physical and sexual abuse, stress, and quality of parenting can greatly influence the occurrence of drug abuse and the escalation to addiction in a person’s life.</p>\r\r<p><b>Development:</b> Genetic and environmental factors interact with critical developmental stages in a person’s life to affect addiction vulnerability. Although taking drugs at any age can lead to addiction, the earlier that drug use begins, the more likely it will progress to more serious abuse, which poses a special challenge to adolescents. Because areas in their brains that govern decision making, judgment, and self-control are still developing, adolescents may be especially prone to risk-taking behaviors, including trying drugs of abuse.</p></div>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:476}}</p>\r\r<p>Physical dependence is not equivalent to dependence or addiction and may occur with the chronic use of any substance, legal or illegal, even when taken as prescribed. It occurs because the body naturally adapts to chronic exposure to a substance (e.g., caffeine or a prescription drug), and when that substance is taken away, symptoms can emerge while the body readjusts to the loss of the substance. Physical dependence can lead to craving for the drug to relieve the withdrawal symptoms. Drug dependence and addiction refer to drug or substance use disorders, which may include physical dependence, but must also meet additional criteria.</p>\r\r<h2>Prevention is the Key</h2>\r\r<p>Drug addiction is a preventable disease. Results from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded research have shown that prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media are effective in reducing drug abuse. Although many events and cultural factors affect drug abuse trends, when youths perceive drug abuse as harmful, they reduce their drug taking. Thus, education and outreach are key in helping youth and the general public understand the risks of drug abuse.

Marijuana\'s effects on the user depend on the strength or potency of the THC it contains. THC potency of marijuana has increased since the 1970s, but has been about the same since the mid-1980s.</p>\r\r<p>Marijuana is usually smoked as a cigarette (called a joint or a nail) or in a pipe or a bong. Recently, it has appeared in cigars called blunts.</p>\r\r<p>THC in marijuana is strongly absorbed by fatty tissues in various organs. Generally, traces (metabolites) of THC can be detected by standard urine testing methods several days after a smoking session.

Users of the drug say that it produces profoundly positive feelings, empathy for others, elimination of anxiety, and extreme relaxation. MDMA is also said to suppress the need to eat, drink, or sleep, enabling users to endure two- to three-day parties. Consequently, MDMA use sometimes results in severe dehydration or exhaustion.</p>\r\r<h3>Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>Ecstasy users are often seen with baby pacifiers or an athletic mouthpiece because they often involuntarily grind their teeth while under the influence of Ecstasy. Chemical lightsticks and painter\'s or surgeon\'s masks smeared with scented ointments such as vapor rub or other scented muscle ointments often are used while taking Ecstasy.

Smoking involves inhaling cocaine vapor or smoke into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream is as rapid as by injection.</p>\r\r<p>"Crack" is the street name given to cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a free-base for smoking. Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine by using ether, crack cocaine is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and then heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form of cocaine that can be smoked. The term "crack" refers to the crackling sound heard when the mixture is smoked (heated), presumably from the sodium bicarbonate.</p>\r\r<p>There is great risk whether cocaine is ingested or absorbed by inhalation (snorting), injection, or smoking. It appears that compulsive cocaine use may develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted.

It was tested on animals and humans, and found to be medically useful as an anesthetic for surgery. Parke Davis marketed it for a short amount of time as a surgical anesthetic for humans under the trade name Sernyl®, but it caused agitation, delusions, and terrifying hallucinations in patients after surgery. Because of these side effects, it was removed from the human market and sold to veterinarians for surgery on animals under the trade name Sernylan®. PCP became more and more known as a recreational drug, and legitimate veterinary supplies were increasingly diverted for illicit sale. The commercial product Sernylan® was withdrawn from the market in 1978. PCP is still made in clandestine laboratories and is sold on the street by such names as "angel dust," "ozone," "wack," and "rocket fuel." "Killer joints" and "crystal supergrass" are names that refer to PCP combined with marijuana. The variety of street names for PCP reflects its bizarre and volatile effects. PCP is a white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water or alcohol. It has a distinctive bitter chemical taste. PCP can be mixed easily with dyes and turns up on the illicit drug market in a variety of tablets, capsules, and colored powders. It is normally used in one of three ways: snorted, smoked, or eaten.

It is considered a recreational beverage when consumed in moderation for enjoyment and relaxation during social gatherings. However, when consumed primarily for its physical and mood-altering effects, it is a substance of abuse. As a depressant, it slows down physical responses and progressively impairs mental functions.</p>\r\r<h3>Description</h3>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li><b>Generic/Chemical Names (Representative):</b> Beer (about 4.5 percent alcohol), wine (about 14 to 20 percent alcohol), distilled spirits or liquor (about 50 percent alcohol).\r<li><b>Alternative Sources:</b> After-shave lotion, cough medicine, antiseptic mouthwash, vanilla extract, disinfectant, room deodorizer fluid, cologne, breath sprays, shaving creams, rubbing alcohol.\r<li><b>Common Street Names:</b> Booze, juice, brew, grain, shine, hooch.\r<li><b>Distinguishing Characteristics:</b> Pure ethanol (sold in some States as “grain alcohol”) is a colorless liquid with a distinctive odor and taste. It has a cooling effect when rubbed on the skin. Most commonly, however, alcohol is consumed as the component of another beverage, and grain alcohol itself is normally diluted with juices or other soft drinks by the consumer. Depending upon the concentration of alcohol in the beverage, the aroma of alcohol may serve as an indicator of the presence of alcohol in a beverage. Since the sale and distribution of all products containing more than a trace amount of ethanol are regulated by Federal and State governments, the best guide to whether a specific beverage contains alcohol will be label information if the original container is available.\r<li><b>Paraphernalia:</b> Liquor, wine, after-shave, or cough medicine bottles; drinking glasses; cans of alcohol-containing beverages; can and bottle openers. Paper bags are sometimes used to conceal the container while the drink is being consumed.\r<li><b>Method of Intake:</b> Alcohol is consumed by mouth. It is infrequently consumed as pure (grain) alcohol. It is, however, frequently consumed in the form in which it is sold (e.g., cans of beer, “straight” liquor, glasses of wine). Alcohol is often consumed in combination with other beverages (“mixers”), either to make it more palatable or to disguise from others that alcohol is being consumed. \r<li><b>Detection Time:</b> The detection time for alcohol depends upon the maximum level of BAC achieved and varies by individual. Since under FMCSA regulations alcohol concentrations as low as 0.02 percent (under DOT testing procedures, breath alcohol concentration is used as a proxy for BAC) require employer action, and current technology can reliably detect this level, a driver who had achieved a moderate level of intoxication (i.e., 0.08 percent BAC) would be detectable approximately 8 hours after achieving that level. (Note: this is detectability after achieving this level and not after commencing or stopping drinking.)\r<li><b>Dependency Level:</b> The chronic use of alcohol can produce dependence in some individuals manifested by craving, withdrawal, and tolerance. Despite the fact that many individuals consume alcoholic beverages (more than 90 percent of Americans at some point during their lives), relatively few of them (only about 10 percent of drinkers) develop psychological and physical dependency on it.\r</ul></div>\r<p>Alcohol is the most commonly used and widely abused psychoactive drug in the country. Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is present in varying amounts in beers and wines, and in distilled liquors such as whiskey, gin, and rum. When a person consumes alcohol, the stomach and intestines rapidly absorb it. From there, alcohol travels in the blood throughout the entire body, affecting nearly every tissue. Moderate and high doses of alcohol depress the functions of the central nervous system, including the brain. The higher the alcohol level is in the blood, the greater the impairment.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:483}}</p>\r\r<p>As blood passes through the liver, enzymes break down alcohol into harmless byproducts, which are eliminated from the body six to eight hours later. But the rate at which alcohol accumulates in the body may be faster than the rate at which the body eliminates it, resulting in rising alcohol levels in the blood. Consequently, alcohol remains in the body, producing intoxicating effects hours after the last drink was swallowed.</p>\r\r<p>Small amounts of alcohol may relieve tension or fatigue, increase appetite, or produce an anesthetic affect that numbs pain. Larger quantities inhibit or depress higher thought processes, bolstering self-confidence and reducing inhibition, anxiety, and guilt. As a person becomes intoxicated, painful or embarrassing situations appear less threatening and, as drinking progresses, speech may become loud and slurred. Impaired judgment may lead to incautious behavior, and physical reflexes and muscular coordination may become noticeably affected.

The effects of alcohol are dependent on a variety of factors, including a person\'s size, weight, age, and sex, as well as the amount of food and alcohol consumed. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is one of the main reasons it is used in so many social situations. Other effects of moderate alcohol intake include dizziness and talkativeness; the immediate effects of a larger amount of alcohol include slurred speech, disturbed sleep, nausea, and vomiting. Alcohol, even at low doses, significantly impairs the judgment and coordination required to drive a vehicle safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol can also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including domestic violence and child abuse. Hangovers are another possible effect after large amounts of alcohol are consumed; a hangover consists of headache, nausea, thirst, dizziness, and fatigue.</p>\r\r<h3>Long-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>Prolonged, heavy use of alcohol can lead to addiction (alcoholism). Sudden cessation of long-term, extensive alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and liver. In addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants may suffer from mental retardation and other irreversible physical abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other children of becoming alcoholics.</p>\r\r<h3>Physical Health Effects</h3>\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ul>\r<li>The liver is the primary site of alcohol metabolism and can be severely affected by heavy alcohol use. The three primary dangers are fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis.\r<li>Heavy alcohol use can also severely affect the gastrointestinal tract, contributing to inflammation of the esophagus, exacerbating peptic ulcers, and causing acute and chronic pancreatitis. It interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food and contributes to malnutrition.\r<li>Heavy alcohol use affects the heart and vascular system, contributing to heart attacks, hypertension, and strokes.\r<li>Either because of direct action or indirectly through the malnutrition, liver disease, and other effects it causes, alcohol depresses immune system functioning and increases the likelihood of infection.\r<li>There is considerable evidence that alcohol abuse is associated with the incidence of cancer, particularly cancers of the liver, esophagus, nasopharynx, and larynx.\r<li>Heavy alcohol consumption causes brain damage, manifested through dementia, blackouts, seizures, hallucinations, and peripheral neuropathy.\r</ul></div>\r<h3>Other Health Effects</h3>\r\r<p>In addition to having direct health effects through physiological changes in the drinker’s body, alcohol contributes significantly to health problems indirectly. While most of the medical consequences of alcohol use listed above result from chronic use, these other effects can often result from a single episode of acute use:\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>One half of all traffic accident fatalities are alcohol-related.\r<li>The risk of a traffic fatality per mile driven is at least eight times higher for a drunk driver than for a sober one.\r<li>Falls are the most common cause of nonfatal injuries in the U.S. and the second-most common cause of fatal accidents. Estimates of the involvement of alcohol in these falls range from 20 to 80 percent. A BAC between 0.05 and 0.10 percent increases the likelihood of a fall by three times. Between 0.10 and 0.15 percent, it increases by a factor of 10, and above 0.16 percent it increases by a factor of 60.\r<li>Research indicates over 60 percent of those dying in nonvehicular fires (fourth leading cause of accidental death in the United States) have BACs over 0.10 percent.\r<li>Approximately 38 percent of those drowning (third leading cause of accidental death in the United States) have been exposed to alcohol at the time of their deaths.\r<li>Between 20 and 36 percent of suicide victims have a history of alcohol abuse or were drinking shortly before their suicides.\r<li>Alcohol also plays a significant role in crime and family violence, including spousal and child abuse.\r</ul></div>\r<h3>Withdrawal Syndrome</h3>\r\r<p>Repeated use of alcohol results in tolerance, with increasing consumption necessary to attain its characteristic effects. Alcohol at a given blood level produces less impairment in heavy drinkers than it does in lighter drinkers. Alcohol is toxic by itself and, coupled with the malnutrition common in alcoholics, can lead to kidney disease, deterioration of mental faculties, and psychotic episodes (the “DTs”) if the alcohol is withdrawn. The DTs are characterized by hallucinations and extreme fear, and their presence are a clear indication of alcohol dependence. Withdrawal and the associated DTs can be fatal.</p>\r\r<h3>Effects on Driver Performance</h3>\r\r<p>The statistics reported above make it clear that alcohol can have a devastating effect on driver performance.

Heavy drinkers lose their appetite and tend to obtain calories from alcohol rather than from ordinary foods. Alcohol is rich in calories and can provide substantial amounts of energy. However, if it constitutes the primary source of calories in place of food, the body will lack vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:484}}</p>\r\r<p>Prolonged use of large amounts of alcohol may cause serious liver damage. In the first stage of liver disease caused by alcohol, fat accumulates in the liver. This stage of the disease is known as “fatty liver.” Most people do not notice symptoms of fatty liver, although in some people the liver becomes enlarged and tender. Some people with fatty liver develop hepatitis, which inflames and kills liver cells. Hepatitis is marked by jaundice, which gives a yellowish tint to the eyes and skin. Others may develop cirrhosis, an irreversible condition in which normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. The scarring prevents blood from traveling freely through the liver, building blood pressure in the veins that run from the intestine to the liver. Consequently, the liver can no longer process toxins efficiently, causing poisons to build up in the blood. This buildup can be fatal.</p>\r\r<p>Heavy drinking also damages heart muscle. Nearly half of all cases of cardiomyopathy are caused by alcohol abuse. In this heart disease, the heart muscles, particularly the right and left ventricles, enlarge and become flabby, reducing the heart\'s blood-pumping efficiency. This inefficiency reduces the flow of blood through the kidneys, which normally filter excess salts and water out of the blood. Eventually the blood volume rises, causing a potentially fatal backup of fluid in the lungs.</p>\r\r<p>Alcoholics tend to have high blood levels of the hormone epinephrine and deficiencies of the mineral magnesium. This combination produces severe arrhythmias, or heartbeat irregularities, a common cause of sudden death in heavy drinkers. Chronic drinkers typically develop hypertension, a leading cause of stroke.</p>\r\r<p>In some cases, alcohol withdrawal may lead to delirium tremens (DTs), which produces increasing confusion, sleeplessness, depression, and terrifying hallucinations. As this delirium progresses, the hands develop a persistent and uncontrollable shaking that may extend to the head and body.</p>\r\r<p>Women who drink excessive amounts of alcohol while pregnant run a high risk of having a baby born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the leading known cause of birth defects. FAS results in a combination of mental and physical defects, such as retardation, a small head, and poor muscle tone.

Prior to conducting the test, you must inform the applicant or driver in writing of the testing requirements.</p>\r\r<p>The purpose of pre-employment testing is to deter and detect controlled substances abuse by driver-applicants. Pre-employment testing identifies drivers who could bring a controlled substances problem into your organization.</p>\r\r<p>A driver-applicant shall not be allowed to perform as a driver unless the employer has a verified negative controlled substances test result from the Medical Review Officer (MRO) for the driver-applicant.</p>\r\r<p>You are required to conduct pre-employment tests each time a driver returns to work after a layoff period when the driver has not been subjected to random controlled substances testing for more than 30 days or has been employed by another entity. You must notify a driver-applicant of the results of a pre-employment controlled substances test if the driver-applicant requests the results within 60 days of being notified of the disposition of the employment application.</p>\r\r<h3>Reasonable Suspicion Testing</h3>\r\r<p>The FMCSA regulations require you to test a driver if a trained supervisor has reasonable suspicion that the driver has used a controlled substance or has misused alcohol as defined in the regulations (§ 382.307). The request to undergo a reasonable suspicion test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor of the driver. These observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. The chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances may not be the sole indicator for reasonable suspicion, but may be used in conjunction with other indicators.</p>\r\r<p>Reasonable suspicion testing is designed to provide you with a tool to identify affected drivers who, through alcohol or controlled substances misuse, may pose a danger to themselves and others in their performance of safety-sensitive functions.

An accident is defined as an occurrence involving a CMV operating on a public road that results in (1) a fatality; or (2) bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or (3) one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:760}}</p>\r\r<p>There is a significant difference between reasonable suspicion testing and post-accident testing. Reasonable suspicion requires some indication of a link between witnessed behavior and substance abuse before a test can be requested.

Drivers subject to post-accident testing must refrain from using alcohol for 8 hours following the accident or until completing a post-accident alcohol test, whichever comes first. It is imperative that you provide drivers with necessary post-accident information, procedures, and instructions prior to their operating a CMV, so that they and you will be able to comply with the regulations. This requirement is especially important if your operations occur in remote areas.</p>\r\r<h3>Random Testing</h3>\r\r<p>The FMCSA regulations require random testing for all drivers subject to the commercial drivers license requirements (§ 382.305). Random testing identifies drivers who use controlled substances or misuse alcohol but are unable to predict the test as they would in the case of post-accident or pre-employment testing. More importantly, it is widely believed that random testing serves as a strong deterrent against drivers beginning or continuing prohibited controlled substances use and misuse of alcohol.</p>\r\r<p>You must use a scientifically valid random selection method to select drivers for testing. Drivers can be chosen from selection pools in several ways. These include semiautomatic methods (using personal computers) or manual methods (using random number tables). The computer-based methods are generally more efficient, but the manual methods can be equally fair and credible.</p>\r\r<p>Commercially available computer-based, random number-generating software programs enable you to match drivers to numbers and to select names from those lists for random controlled substances and alcohol tests. Some of these programs are comprehensive, including scheduling and recordkeeping functions. Alternatively, spreadsheet programs, commonly used for financial and operational analyses, often include a routine that provides random numbers. Those random numbers can be assigned to your driver list and used for selecting drivers to be tested. Because your driver pool may fluctuate, the list of driver names must be updated each time the pool fluctuates for smaller employers and at least monthly for larger employers.</p>\r\r<p>If a computer program is not available for random selection, a manual sampling technique that uses a random number table may be used. These tables are found in many statistics textbooks available in libraries and bookstores. The scientific community does not consider drawing names out of a hat or container to be a scientifically valid method for sampling. While this technique is simple and appears fair because it can be done in full view of the affected drivers, it is actually less random than using a computer or a random number table because of inconsistencies in paper size, as well as the lack of control over the names included or excluded. Also, it is very difficult to document how a selection is made and who is selected for testing.</p>\r\r<p>The test dates must be spread reasonably throughout the year and should not establish a predictable pattern (e.g., the first Monday of each month). The number of tests conducted weekly, monthly, or quarterly should remain relatively constant to the extent possible; however, drivers selected for that testing cycle must be tested. Conducting all of your tests in one month, for example, does not achieve the goal of random testing. Likewise, the testing should be performed on different days of the week and at different times throughout the annual cycle. This helps to prevent drivers from coordinating their controlled substances and alcohol use to the random testing schedule.</p>\r\r<p>The current random testing rates under FMCSA regulations are 50 percent for controlled substances and 10 percent for alcohol. This means that the number of tests to be administered each year is equal to at least 50 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the average number of driver positions subject to these regulations.

Most binge and heavy alcohol users are also employed full or part time.</p>\r\r<p>Illicit drug use in America has been increasing. In 2011, an estimated 22.5 million Americans aged 12 or older—or 8.7 percent of the population—had used an illicit drug or abused a psychotherapeutic medication (such as a pain reliever, stimulant, or tranquilizer) in the past month. This is up from 8.3 percent in 2002. The increase mostly reflects a recent rise in the use of marijuana, the most commonly used illicit drug.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:473}}</p>\r\r<p>Substance abusing employees often do not make good employees.

	(519, 'oc0620.2_04', '<h2>Understanding Drug Abuse</h2><p>Many people do not understand why or how other people become addicted to drugs. It is often mistakenly assumed that drug abusers lack moral principles or willpower and that they could stop using drugs simply by choosing to change their behavior. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting takes more than good intentions or a strong will. In fact, because drugs change the brain in ways that foster compulsive drug abuse, quitting is difficult, even for those who are ready to do so. Through scientific advances, we know more about how drugs work in the brain than ever, and we also know that drug addiction can be successfully treated to help people stop abusing drugs and start leading productive lives.</p>\r\r<p>Drug abuse and addiction have negative economic consequences for individuals and for society. Estimates of the total overall costs of substance abuse in the United States, including productivity and health- and crime-related costs, exceed 600 billion dollars annually. This includes approximately 193 billion dollars for illicit drugs, 193 billion dollars for tobacco, and 235 billion dollars for alcohol. As staggering as these numbers are, they do not fully describe the breadth of destructive public health and safety implications of drug abuse and addiction, such as family disintegration, loss of employment, failure in school, domestic violence, and child abuse.</p>\r\r<h3>Drug Addiction</h3>\r\r<p>Addiction is a chronic, often relapsing, brain disease that causes compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences to the addicted individual and to those around him or her. Although the initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, the brain changes that occur over time challenge an addicted person’s self control and hamper his or her ability to resist intense impulses to take drugs.</p>\r\r<p>Fortunately, treatments are available to help people counter addiction’s powerful disruptive effects. Research shows that combining addiction treatment medications with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for most patients. Treatment approaches that are tailored to each patient’s drug abuse patterns and any co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and social problems can lead to sustained recovery and a life without drug abuse.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:474}}</p>\r\r<p>Similar to other chronic, relapsing diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, drug addiction can be managed successfully. And as with other chronic diseases, it is not uncommon for a person to relapse and begin abusing drugs again. Relapse, however, does not signal treatment failure—rather, it indicates that treatment should be reinstated, adjusted, or that an alternative treatment is needed to help the individual regain control and recover.</p>', 4, 179, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(520, 'oc0620.2_05', '<h3>Physiology</h3><p>Drugs contain chemicals that tap into the brain’s communication system and disrupt the way nerve cells normally send, receive, and process information. There are at least two ways that drugs cause this disruption: (1) by imitating the brain’s natural chemical messengers and (2) by overstimulating the “reward circuit” of the brain.</p>\r\r<p>Some drugs (e.g., marijuana and heroin) have a similar structure to chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, which are naturally produced by the brain. This similarity allows the drugs to “fool” the brain’s receptors and activate nerve cells to send abnormal messages.</p>\r\r<p>Other drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine, can cause the nerve cells to release abnormally large amounts of natural neurotransmitters (mainly dopamine) or to prevent the normal recycling of these brain chemicals, which is needed to shut off the signaling between neurons. The result is a brain awash in dopamine, a neurotransmitter present in brain regions that control movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. The overstimulation of this reward system, which normally responds to natural behaviors linked to survival (eating, spending time with loved ones, etc.), produces euphoric effects in response to psychoactive drugs. This reaction sets in motion a reinforcing pattern that “teaches” people to repeat the rewarding behavior of abusing drugs.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:475}}</p> \r\r<p>As a person continues to abuse drugs, the brain adapts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine by producing less dopamine or by reducing the number of dopamine receptors in the reward circuit. The result is a lessening of dopamine’s impact on the reward circuit, which reduces the abuser’s ability to enjoy not only the drugs but also other events in life that previously brought pleasure. This decrease compels the addicted person to keep abusing drugs in an attempt to bring the dopamine function back to normal, but now larger amounts of the drug are required to achieve the same dopamine high—an effect known as tolerance.</p>\r\r<p>Long-term abuse causes changes in other brain chemical systems and circuits as well. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that influences the reward circuit and the ability to learn. When the optimal concentration of glutamate is altered by drug abuse, the brain attempts to compensate, which can impair cognitive function. Brain imaging studies of drug-addicted individuals show changes in areas of the brain that are critical to judgment, decision making, learning and memory, and behavior control. Together, these changes can drive an abuser to seek out and take drugs compulsively despite adverse, even devastating consequences—that is the nature of addiction.</p>', 5, 170, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(521, 'oc0620.2_06', '<h3>Addiction</h3><p>No single factor can predict whether a person will become addicted to drugs. Risk for addiction is influenced by a combination of factors that include individual biology, social environment, and age or stage of development. The more risk factors an individual has, the greater the chance that taking drugs can lead to addiction. For example:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<p><b>Biology:</b> The genes that people are born with—in combination with environmental influences—account for about half of their addiction vulnerability. Additionally, gender, ethnicity, and the presence of other mental disorders may influence risk for drug abuse and addiction.</p>\r\r<p><b>Environment:</b> A person’s environment includes many different influences, from family and friends to socioeconomic status and quality of life in general. Factors such as peer pressure, physical and sexual abuse, stress, and quality of parenting can greatly influence the occurrence of drug abuse and the escalation to addiction in a person’s life.</p>\r\r<p><b>Development:</b> Genetic and environmental factors interact with critical developmental stages in a person’s life to affect addiction vulnerability. Although taking drugs at any age can lead to addiction, the earlier that drug use begins, the more likely it will progress to more serious abuse, which poses a special challenge to adolescents. Because areas in their brains that govern decision making, judgment, and self-control are still developing, adolescents may be especially prone to risk-taking behaviors, including trying drugs of abuse.</p></div>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:476}}</p>\r\r<p>Physical dependence is not equivalent to dependence or addiction and may occur with the chronic use of any substance, legal or illegal, even when taken as prescribed. It occurs because the body naturally adapts to chronic exposure to a substance (e.g., caffeine or a prescription drug), and when that substance is taken away, symptoms can emerge while the body readjusts to the loss of the substance. Physical dependence can lead to craving for the drug to relieve the withdrawal symptoms. Drug dependence and addiction refer to drug or substance use disorders, which may include physical dependence, but must also meet additional criteria.</p>\r\r<h2>Prevention is the Key</h2>\r\r<p>Drug addiction is a preventable disease. Results from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded research have shown that prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media are effective in reducing drug abuse. Although many events and cultural factors affect drug abuse trends, when youths perceive drug abuse as harmful, they reduce their drug taking. Thus, education and outreach are key in helping youth and the general public understand the risks of drug abuse. Teachers, parents, medical, and public health professionals must keep sending the message that drug addiction can be prevented if one never abuses drugs.</p>', 6, 182, 1, NULL, NULL),

It was tested on animals and humans, and found to be medically useful as an anesthetic for surgery. Parke Davis marketed it for a short amount of time as a surgical anesthetic for humans under the trade name Sernyl®, but it caused agitation, delusions, and terrifying hallucinations in patients after surgery. Because of these side effects, it was removed from the human market and sold to veterinarians for surgery on animals under the trade name Sernylan®. PCP became more and more known as a recreational drug, and legitimate veterinary supplies were increasingly diverted for illicit sale. The commercial product Sernylan® was withdrawn from the market in 1978. PCP is still made in clandestine laboratories and is sold on the street by such names as "angel dust," "ozone," "wack," and "rocket fuel." "Killer joints" and "crystal supergrass" are names that refer to PCP combined with marijuana. The variety of street names for PCP reflects its bizarre and volatile effects. PCP is a white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water or alcohol. It has a distinctive bitter chemical taste. PCP can be mixed easily with dyes and turns up on the illicit drug market in a variety of tablets, capsules, and colored powders. It is normally used in one of three ways: snorted, smoked, or eaten. For smoking, PCP is often applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano, or marijuana.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:482}}</p>\n\n<h3>Short-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>At low to moderate doses, physiological effects include a slight increase in breathing rate and a more pronounced rise in blood pressure and pulse rate. Respiration becomes shallow, and flushing and profuse sweating occurs. Generalized numbness of the extremities and muscular incoordination may also occur. Psychological effects include distinct changes in body awareness, similar to those associated with alcohol intoxication. At high doses, there is a drop in blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, flicking up and down of the eyes, drooling, loss of balance, and dizziness. High doses of PCP can also cause seizures, coma, and death (though death more often results from accidental injury or suicide during PCP intoxication). Psychological effects at high doses include illusions and hallucinations. PCP may have effects that mimic certain primary symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions, mental turmoil, and a sensation of distance from one\'s environment. Sometimes, speech is sparse and mangled. Other effects include inability to feel physical pain, anxiety, disorientation, fear, panic and paranoia, aggressive behavior and violence.</p>\r\r<h3>Long-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>People who use PCP for long periods of time report memory loss, speech difficulties, depression, and weight loss. When given psychomotor tests, PCP users tend to have lost their fine motor skills and short-term memory. Mood disorders have also been reported. PCP has sedative effects, and interactions with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and benzodiazepines can lead to coma or death.</p>\n\n<h3>Health Hazards</h3>\r\r<p>PCP is addicting; that is, its use often leads to psychological dependence, craving, and compulsive PCP-seeking behavior. It was first introduced as a street drug in the 1960s and quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. Many people, after using the drug once, will not knowingly use it again. Yet others use it consistently and regularly. Some persist in using PCP because of its addicting properties. Others cite feelings of strength, power, invulnerability, and a numbing effect on the mind as reasons for their continued PCP use.</p>\n\n<p>Many PCP users are brought to emergency rooms because of PCP\'s unpleasant psychological effects or because of overdoses.

	(529, 'oc0620.2_14', '<h2>Alcohol</h2><p>Alcohol is the most commonly used and widely abused psychoactive drug in the country. Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is present in varying amounts in beers and wines, and in distilled liquors such as whiskey, gin, and rum. When a person consumes alcohol, the stomach and intestines rapidly absorb it. From there, alcohol travels in the blood throughout the entire body, affecting nearly every tissue. Moderate and high doses of alcohol depress the functions of the central nervous system, including the brain. The higher the alcohol level is in the blood, the greater the impairment.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:483}}</p>\r\r<p>As blood passes through the liver, enzymes break down alcohol into harmless byproducts, which are eliminated from the body six to eight hours later. But the rate at which alcohol accumulates in the body may be faster than the rate at which the body eliminates it, resulting in rising alcohol levels in the blood. Consequently, alcohol remains in the body, producing intoxicating effects hours after the last drink was swallowed.</p>\r\r<p>Small amounts of alcohol may relieve tension or fatigue, increase appetite, or produce an anesthetic affect that numbs pain. Larger quantities inhibit or depress higher thought processes, bolstering self-confidence and reducing inhibition, anxiety, and guilt. As a person becomes intoxicated, painful or embarrassing situations appear less threatening and, as drinking progresses, speech may become loud and slurred. Impaired judgment may lead to incautious behavior, and physical reflexes and muscular coordination may become noticeably affected. If drinking continues, complete loss of physical control follows, ending in stupor, and possibly death.</p>\n\n<h3>Short-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>When a person drinks alcohol, the alcohol is absorbed by the stomach, enters the bloodstream, and travels to all of the tissues. The effects of alcohol are dependent on a variety of factors, including a person\'s size, weight, age, and sex, as well as the amount of food and alcohol consumed. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is one of the main reasons it is used in so many social situations. Other effects of moderate alcohol intake include dizziness and talkativeness; the immediate effects of a larger amount of alcohol include slurred speech, disturbed sleep, nausea, and vomiting. Alcohol, even at low doses, significantly impairs the judgment and coordination required to drive a vehicle safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol can also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including domestic violence and child abuse. Hangovers are another possible effect after large amounts of alcohol are consumed; a hangover consists of headache, nausea, thirst, dizziness, and fatigue.</p>\r\r<h3>Long-Term Drug Effects</h3>\r\r<p>Prolonged, heavy use of alcohol can lead to addiction (alcoholism). Sudden cessation of long-term, extensive alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and liver. In addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants may suffer from mental retardation and other irreversible physical abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other children of becoming alcoholics.</p>\n<h2>Duration of Single Dose Effect</h2><p>Alcohol is fully absorbed into the bloodstream within 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending upon the beverage consumed and associated food intake. The body can metabolize about one quarter of an ounce (0.25 oz.—roughly half the amount in a can of beer) of alcohol per hour.</p>\r\r<p>The effects of alcohol on behavior (including driving behavior) vary with the individual and with the concentration of alcohol in the individual’s blood. The level of alcohol achieved in the blood depends in large part (although not exclusively) upon the amount of alcohol consumed and the time period over which it was consumed. One rule of thumb says that in a 150-pound person, each drink adds 0.02% to blood alcohol concentration and each hour that passes removes 0.01 percent from it.</p>\r\r<p>Generally speaking, alcohol is absorbed into the blood relatively quickly and metabolized more slowly.

Some people with fatty liver develop hepatitis, which inflames and kills liver cells. Hepatitis is marked by jaundice, which gives a yellowish tint to the eyes and skin. Others may develop cirrhosis, an irreversible condition in which normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. The scarring prevents blood from traveling freely through the liver, building blood pressure in the veins that run from the intestine to the liver. Consequently, the liver can no longer process toxins efficiently, causing poisons to build up in the blood. This buildup can be fatal.</p>\r\r<p>Heavy drinking also damages heart muscle. Nearly half of all cases of cardiomyopathy are caused by alcohol abuse. In this heart disease, the heart muscles, particularly the right and left ventricles, enlarge and become flabby, reducing the heart\'s blood-pumping efficiency. This inefficiency reduces the flow of blood through the kidneys, which normally filter excess salts and water out of the blood. Eventually the blood volume rises, causing a potentially fatal backup of fluid in the lungs.</p>\r\r<p>Alcoholics tend to have high blood levels of the hormone epinephrine and deficiencies of the mineral magnesium. This combination produces severe arrhythmias, or heartbeat irregularities, a common cause of sudden death in heavy drinkers. Chronic drinkers typically develop hypertension, a leading cause of stroke.</p>\r\r<p>In some cases, alcohol withdrawal may lead to delirium tremens (DTs), which produces increasing confusion, sleeplessness, depression, and terrifying hallucinations. As this delirium progresses, the hands develop a persistent and uncontrollable shaking that may extend to the head and body.</p>\r\r<p>Women who drink excessive amounts of alcohol while pregnant run a high risk of having a baby born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the leading known cause of birth defects. FAS results in a combination of mental and physical defects, such as retardation, a small head, and poor muscle tone.

	(546, 'ds-d43_08', '<h2>Neurosurgery</h2><p>Surgery is usually the first step in treating an accessible tumor—one that can be removed without unacceptable risk of neurological damage. Surgery is aimed at removing all or as much tumor as possible (called resecting or excising) and can often slow worsening of neurological function.</p>\n\n<p>An inaccessible or inoperable tumor is one that cannot be removed surgically because of the risk of severe nervous system damage during the operation. These tumors are frequently located deep within the brain or near vital structures such as the brain stem.</p>\n\n<p>A biopsy is usually performed to help doctors determine how to treat a tumor. A brain biopsy involves surgically removing a small part of the skull to sample the tumor tissue. A needle inserted through a small hole can sometimes perform biopsies. A small piece of tissue remains in the hollow needle when it is removed from the body. A pathologist will stain and examine the tissue for certain changes that signal cancer and grade it to reflect the degree of malignancy.</p>\n\n<p>If the sample is cancerous, the surgeons will remove as much of the tumor as possible. For some primary brain tumors it is not possible to surgically remove all malignant cells. Malignant brain tumors commonly recur from cells that have spread from the original tumor mass into the surrounding brain tissue. In contrast, many benign tumors and secondary metastatic tumors can be completely removed surgically.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:120}}</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, a surgeon may need to insert a shunt into the skull to drain any dangerous buildup of CSF caused by the tumor. A shunt is a flexible plastic tube that is used to divert the flow of CSF from the central nervous system to another part of the body, where it can be absorbed as part of the normal circulatory process.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, research has led to advances in neurosurgery that make it possible for doctors to completely remove many tumors that were previously thought to be inoperable. These new techniques and tools let neurosurgeons operate within the tight, vulnerable confines of the CNS. Some tools used in the operating room include a surgical microscope, the endoscope (a small viewing tube attached to a video camera), and miniature precision instruments that allow surgery to be performed through a small incision in the brain or spine.</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<p><b>Intraoperative MRI</b> uses a special type of MRI to provide a real-time evaluation of the surgery. Constantly updated images that are provided during surgery let doctors see how much tumor material has been removed. Intraoperative MRI can also help doctors choose the best surgical approaches and monitor any complications during surgery.</p>\n\n<p><b>Navigation equipment</b> used in computer-guided, or stereotactic, neurosurgery gives doctors a precise, three-dimensional map of an individual’s spine or brain as the operation progresses. A computer uses pre-operative diagnostic images of the individual to reduce the risk of damage to surrounding tissue.</p>\n\n<p><b>Intraoperative nerve monitoring tests</b> such as evoked potentials use real-time recordings of nerve cell activity to determine the role of specific nerves and monitor brain activity as the surgery progresses. Small electrodes are used to stimulate a nerve and measure its electrical response (or evoked potential). Some surgeries may be done while the individual is awake under monitored anesthesia care rather than under general anesthesia. This allows doctors to monitor the individual’s speech and motor functions as a tumor is being removed.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A possible side effect of surgery is swelling around the site of the tumor. This can be treated with steroids. Bleeding into the tumor site or infection are other serious risks of brain surgery.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of metastatic tumors, doctors usually treat the original cancer. However, if there are only one or two metastases to the brain or if a metastatic tumor causes serious disability or pain, doctors may recommend surgery—even if the original cancer has not been controlled.</p>\n\n<p>Surgery may be the beginning and end of a patient’s treatment if the biopsy shows a benign tumor. If the tumor is malignant, doctors often recommend additional treatment including radiation and chemotherapy or one of several experimental treatments.</p>', 8, 268, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(547, 'ds-d43_13', '<h1>Clinical Research Studies (Cont.)</h1><p>Certain enzymes that are involved in cell division or the copying of genetic information may be over-produced in cancer cells causing gene mutations and uncontrolled cell growth. Several different types of kinase inhibitors—proteins that block growth-signaling enzymes without harming normal cells—have been identified and approved for cancer treatment.  Scientists are testing protein-level kinase inhibitors to see if they make CNS tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy. Clinical trials for brain tumors are studying the safety and effectiveness of kinase inhibitors in children with CNS tumors and in other patients with recurring or hard to treat tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-sense oligonucleotide technology uses short fragments of nucleic acid molecules to block gene expression in specific cells and prevent tumor growth. Unlike gene therapy, anti-sense oligonucleotide technology does not replace or substitute genetic material but inhibits the expression of select targets. This technology (also known as RNA interference, siRNA, or shRNA) may help scientists to identify additional genes involved in tumor formation and improve drug delivery with fewer side effects.</p>\n\n<p>Of particular interest are microRNAs (or miRNAs)—naturally occurring molecules that regulate gene expression and are involved in the formation and development of tumor stem cells. Researchers are using miRNAs to switch off tumor stem cell activity. Researchers are studying miRNAs as a possible diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for brain tumors and other forms of cancer.</p>\n\n<p><b>Biomarkers</b> are molecules or other substances in the blood or tissue that can be used to diagnose or monitor a particular disorder, among other functions. As cells become cancerous, they can release unique proteins and other molecules into the body that scientists use to speed diagnosis and treatment. Some CNS tumor biomarkers have been found, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGRF) gene. Researchers continue to search for additional clinical biomarkers of CNS tumors to better assess risk from environmental toxins and other possible causes, and to monitor and predict the outcome of CNS tumor treatment. NINDS-funded research has recently shown that mutation analysis of EGFR can be used to predict which tumors are most likely to respond to a specific class of cancer-fighting drugs. Identifying biomarkers may also lead to the development of new models of disease and novel therapies for tumor treatment.</p>\n\n<p><b>Radiation therapy</b> research includes testing several new anticancer drugs, either independently or in combination with other drugs. Researchers are also testing different drugs in combination with other therapies and are investigating combined therapies such as radiation and radiosurgery to effectively treat CNS tumors. Research areas being explored include tomotherapy, boron nuclear capture therapy, liquid radiation therapy, and the use of radiosensitizers.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:124}}</p>\n\n<p>Radiosensitizers are drugs that make rapidly dividing tumor tissue more vulnerable to radiation. Early studies using radiosensitizers produced mixed results. While some trials suggested these drugs might improve survival in certain patients, other trials were found to have little benefit. Scientists are now testing an experimental drug that increases the amount of oxygen that is released from the blood into the tissues, making cancer cells more responsive to radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show the lack of oxygen in a tumor can make radiation therapy less effective.</p>\n\n<p>Tomotherapy combines CT scanning and intensity modulated radiation therapy to deliver small beams of high-dose radiation to the tumor while greatly reducing radiation exposure to surrounding tissue. Studies are examining the effectiveness of radiation delivery through tomotherapy to see if long-term side effects of radiation therapy can be reduced.</p>\n\n<p>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an experimental treatment that uses fission to kill tumor cells. An amino acid or other drug that carries boron is injected into the patient, where it collects more readily in tumor cells than in regular tissue.  A beam of low-energy neutrons is directed at the tumor from outside the body causing the boron atoms to split (called neutron capture) and send high amounts of energy into the cancerous cells. Radiation damage to surrounding cells is extremely small. BNCT is being tested as a post-surgery treatment for patients with certain head and neck tumors. If successful, BNCT could someday be used to treat children with brain tumors.</p>\n\n<p>Liquid radiation therapy is an experimental treatment that uses a balloon catheter to deliver internal radiation therapy to the cavity that remains following tumor surgery. A radioactive liquid is injected into the catheter and molds the balloon to the exact edges of the cavity. The liquid stays in the balloon for several days until it and the catheter are removed.</p>', 13, 322, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(548, 'ds-d43_14', '<h1>Clinical Research Studies (Cont.)</h1><p><b>Chemotherapeutic drug</b> research focuses on ways to better deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier and into the site of the tumor. Since chemotherapeutic drugs work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing, several trials are testing whether giving more than one drug, and perhaps giving them in different ways (such as staggered delivery and low-dose, long-term treatment), may kill more tumor cells without causing or lessening damaging side effects than present therapy. Researchers are examining different levels of chemotherapeutic drugs to determine if they are less toxic to normal tissue when combined with other cancer treatments. Other studies are investigating gene therapy as a way to make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. Research areas include differentiating drugs, osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption, and convection enhanced delivery.</p>\n\n<p>Differentiating drugs change dividing cells into non-dividing cells and can halt tumor growth. An early study using retinoids (made from vitamin A) as an independent treatment for certain tumors showed no significant effect.  Scientists are trying retinoids in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs or treatments to slow the growth of malignant glioma.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers are testing different drugs and molecules to see if they can modulate the normal activity of the blood-brain barrier and better target tumor cells and associated blood vessels.</p>\n\n<p>Osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption uses certain drugs to open blood vessels throughout the brain. Scientists are currently studying whether certain chemotherapeutic drugs, when given with osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption, might be an effective way to kill cancer cells without harmful side effects.</p>\n\n<p>Convection enhanced delivery sends a continuous, uniform stream of toxic drugs into the tumor via catheters that are inserted during surgery. This drug delivery system, which bypasses the blood-brain barrier, is being evaluated in children with recurring brain cancer and in patients whose tumor location prevents its total surgical removal.</p>\n\n<p>Repeat surgical resection has been shown to be beneficial to selected patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. Further studies are ongoing to better define the potential benefits of surgery, including better response to biologic therapy and chemotherapy, improved quality of life, and prolonged survival.</p>\n\n<p>Also under investigation are ways to help the body respond to improved drug delivery or other cancer treatments.  Bone marrow and stem cell transplants may replace blood-forming cells that are killed by chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or a combination of therapies. These transplants, which are given after radiation or chemotherapy, help the patient’s bone marrow recover and produce healthy blood cells. Researchers are studying the effectiveness of these transplants in protecting blood cells in children with certain types of CNS tumors and in other patients with recurrent or hard to treat CNS cancer who receive higher than normal doses of chemotherapy.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:263}}</p>\n\n<p>Although many new approaches to treatment appear promising, it is important to remember that all potential therapies must stand the tests of well-designed, carefully controlled clinical trials and long-term follow-up of treated patients before any conclusions can be drawn about their safety or effectiveness. New trial designs are also being developed to more quickly evaluate novel agents and may involve pre-selection of patients based on the molecular abnormality in their tumor.</p>\n\n<p>Past research has led to improved tumor treatments and techniques for many individuals with CNS tumors. Current research promises to generate further improvements.

	(562, 'ms0107_01', '<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Sleep is increasingly recognized as important to public health, with sleep insufficiency linked to motor vehicle crashes, industrial disasters, and medical and other occupational errors. Unintentionally falling asleep, nodding off while driving, and having difficulty performing daily tasks because of sleepiness all may contribute to these hazardous outcomes. Persons experiencing sleep insufficiency are also more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and obesity, as well as from cancer, increased mortality, and reduced quality of life and productivity. Sleep insufficiency may be caused by broad scale societal factors such as round-the-clock access to technology and work schedules, but sleep disorders such as insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea also play an important role. An estimated 50-70 million U.S. adults have a sleep or wakefulness disorder. This course will discuss sleep and its role in helping maintain our own health and safety and making the workplace a safer place for ourselves, our colleagues, and those people we directly and indirectly come in contact with by the performance of work activities.</p>\r\r{{COURSE_TOOLBAR_DESC}}\r\r<h2>Sleeping</h2>\r\r<p>We know that sleep is important. The need for sleep is biologically similar to the need to eat and drink, and it is critical for maintaining life and health and for working safely. Sleeping 7 to 8 hours a night is linked with a wide range of better health and safety outcomes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been actively involved in research to protect workers, workers’ families, employers, and the community from the hazards linked to long work hours and shift work.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:795}}</p>\r\r<p>While we often consider sleep to be a “passive” activity, sufficient sleep is increasingly being recognized as an essential aspect of health promotion and chronic disease prevention in the public health community.</p>\r\r<p>Insufficient sleep is associated with a number of chronic diseases and conditions—such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression—which threaten our nation’s health. Notably, insufficient sleep is associated with the onset of these diseases and also poses important implications for their management and outcome. Moreover, insufficient sleep is responsible for motor vehicle and machinery-related crashes, causing substantial injury and disability each year. In short, drowsy driving can be as dangerous—and preventable—as driving while intoxicated.</p>\r\r<p>More than one-quarter of the U.S. population report occasionally not getting enough sleep, while nearly 10% experience chronic insomnia. However, new methods for assessing and treating sleep disorders bring hope to the millions suffering from insufficient sleep. Fundamental to the success of all of these efforts is the recognition that sufficient sleep is not a luxury—it is a necessity—and should be thought of as a “vital sign” of good health.</p>', 1, 221, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(563, 'ms0107_02', '<h2>Sleep: A Dynamic Activity</h2><p>Until the 1950s, most people thought of sleep as a passive, dormant part of our daily lives. We now know that our brains are very active during sleep. Moreover, sleep affects our daily functioning and our physical and mental health in many ways that we are just beginning to understand.</p>\r\r<p>Nerve-signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters control whether we are asleep or awake by acting on different groups of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. Neurons in the brainstem, which connects the brain with the spinal cord, produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine that keep some parts of the brain active while we are awake. Other neurons at the base of the brain begin signaling when we fall asleep. These neurons appear to "switch off" the signals that keep us awake. Research also suggests that a chemical called adenosine builds up in our blood while we are awake and causes drowsiness. This chemical gradually breaks down while we sleep.</p>\r\r<p>During sleep, we usually pass through five phases of sleep: stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. These stages progress in a cycle from stage 1 to REM sleep, then the cycle starts over again with stage 1. We spend almost 50 percent of our total sleep time in stage 2 sleep, about 20 percent in REM sleep, and the remaining 30 percent in the other stages. Infants, by contrast, spend about half of their sleep time in REM sleep.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:794}}</p>\r\r<p>During stage 1, which is light sleep, we drift in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily. Our eyes move very slowly and muscle activity slows. People awakened from stage 1 sleep often remember fragmented visual images. Many also experience sudden muscle contractions called hypnic myoclonia, often preceded by a sensation of starting to fall. These sudden movements are similar to the "jump" we make when startled. When we enter stage 2 sleep, our eye movements stop and our brain waves become slower, with occasional bursts of rapid waves called sleep spindles. In stage 3, extremely slow brain waves called delta waves begin to appear, interspersed with smaller, faster waves. By stage 4, the brain produces delta waves almost exclusively. It is very difficult to wake someone during stages 3 and 4, which together are called deep sleep. There is no eye movement or muscle activity. People awakened during deep sleep do not adjust immediately and often feel groggy and disoriented for several minutes after they wake up. Some children experience bedwetting, night terrors, or sleepwalking during deep sleep.</p>\r\r<p>When we switch into REM sleep, our breathing becomes more rapid, irregular, and shallow, our eyes jerk rapidly in various directions, and our limb muscles become temporarily paralyzed. Our heart rate increases, our blood pressure rises, and males develop penile erections. When people awaken during REM sleep, they often describe bizarre and illogical tales—dreams.</p>\r\r<p>The first REM sleep period usually occurs about 70 to 90 minutes after we fall asleep. A complete sleep cycle takes 90 to 110 minutes on average. The first sleep cycles each night contain relatively short REM periods and long periods of deep sleep. As the night progresses, REM sleep periods increase in length while deep sleep decreases. By morning, people spend nearly all their sleep time in stages 1, 2, and REM.</p>\r\r<p>People awakened after sleeping more than a few minutes are usually unable to recall the last few minutes before they fell asleep. This sleep-related form of amnesia is the reason people often forget telephone calls or conversations they\'ve had in the middle of the night. It also explains why we often do not remember our alarms ringing in the morning if we go right back to sleep after turning them off.</p>\r\r<p>Since sleep and wakefulness are influenced by different neurotransmitter signals in the brain, foods and medicines that change the balance of these signals affect whether we feel alert or drowsy and how well we sleep. Caffeinated drinks such as coffee and drugs such as diet pills and decongestants stimulate some parts of the brain and can cause insomnia, or an inability to sleep. Many antidepressants suppress REM sleep. Heavy smokers often sleep very lightly and have reduced amounts of REM sleep. They also tend to wake up after 3 or 4 hours of sleep due to nicotine withdrawal. Many people who suffer from insomnia try to solve the problem with alcohol—the so-called night cap. While alcohol does help people fall into light sleep, it also robs them of REM and the deeper, more restorative stages of sleep. Instead, it keeps them in the lighter stages of sleep, from which they can be awakened easily.</p>\r\r<p>People lose some of the ability to regulate their body temperature during REM, so abnormally hot or cold temperatures in the environment can disrupt this stage of sleep. If our REM sleep is disrupted one night, our bodies don\'t follow the normal sleep cycle progression the next time we doze off. Instead, we often slip directly into REM sleep and go through extended periods of REM until we "catch up" on this stage of sleep.</p>\r\r<p>People who are under anesthesia or in a coma are often said to be asleep. However, people in these conditions cannot be awakened and do not produce the complex, active brain wave patterns seen in normal sleep. Instead, their brain waves are very slow and weak, sometimes all but undetectable.</p>', 2, 364, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(564, 'ms0107_03', '<h2>Importance of Sleep</h2><p>Although scientists are still trying to learn exactly why people need sleep, animal studies show that sleep is necessary for survival. For example, while rats normally live for two to three years, those deprived of REM sleep survive only about 5 weeks on average, and rats deprived of all sleep stages live only about 3 weeks. Sleep-deprived rats also develop abnormally low body temperatures and sores on their tail and paws. The sores may develop because the rats\' immune systems become impaired. Some studies suggest that sleep deprivation affects the immune system in detrimental ways.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_RESOURCE_VIDEO:1119}}</p>\r\r<p>Sleep appears necessary for our nervous systems to work properly. Too little sleep leaves us drowsy and unable to concentrate the next day. It also leads to impaired memory and physical performance and reduced ability to carry out math calculations. If sleep deprivation continues, hallucinations and mood swings may develop. Some experts believe sleep gives neurons used while we are awake a chance to shut down and repair themselves. Without sleep, neurons may become so depleted in energy or so polluted with byproducts of normal cellular activities that they begin to malfunction. Sleep also may give the brain a chance to exercise important neuronal connections that might otherwise deteriorate from lack of activity.</p>\r\r<p>Deep sleep coincides with the release of growth hormones in children and young adults. Many of the body\'s cells also show increased production and reduced breakdown of proteins during deep sleep. Since proteins are the building blocks needed for cell growth and for repair of damage from factors like stress and ultraviolet rays, deep sleep may truly be "beauty sleep." Activity in parts of the brain that control emotions, decision-making processes, and social interactions is drastically reduced during deep sleep, suggesting that this type of sleep may help people maintain optimal emotional and social functioning while they are awake. A study in rats also showed that certain nerve-signaling patterns that the rats generated during the day were repeated during deep sleep. This pattern repetition may help encode memories and improve learning.</p>', 3, 138, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(565, 'ms0107_04', '<h2>Key Sleep Disorders</h2><p>Sleep-related difficulties affect many people. The following is a description of some of the major sleep disorders. If you, or someone you know, is experiencing any of the following, it is important to receive an evaluation by a healthcare provider or, if necessary, a provider specializing in sleep medicine.</p>\r\r<h3>Insomnia</h3>\r\r<p>Insomnia is characterized by an inability to initiate or maintain sleep. It may also take the form of <i>early morning awakening</i> in which the individual awakens several hours early and is unable to resume sleeping. Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep may often manifest itself as <i>excessive daytime sleepiness</i>, which characteristically results in functional impairment throughout the day. Before arriving at a diagnosis of primary insomnia, the healthcare provider will rule out other potential causes, such as other sleep disorders, side effects of medications, substance abuse, depression, or other previously undetected illness. <i>Chronic psychophysiological insomnia</i> (or “learned” or “conditioned” insomnia) may result from a stressor combined with fear of being unable to sleep. Individuals with this condition may sleep better when not in their own beds. Health care providers may treat chronic insomnia with a combination of use of sedative-hypnotic or sedating antidepressant medications, along with behavioral techniques to promote regular sleep.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:796}}</p>\r\r<h3>Narcolepsy</h3>\r\r<p>Excessive daytime sleepiness (including episodes of <i>irresistible sleepiness</i>) combined with sudden muscle weakness are the hallmark signs of narcolepsy. The sudden muscle weakness seen in narcolepsy may be elicited by strong emotion or surprise. Episodes of narcolepsy have been described as “sleep attacks” and may occur in unusual circumstances, such as walking and other forms of physical activity. The healthcare provider may treat narcolepsy with stimulant medications combined with behavioral interventions, such as regularly scheduled naps, to minimize the potential disruptiveness of narcolepsy on the individual’s life.</p>\r\r<h3>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</h3>\r\r<p>RLS is characterized by an unpleasant “creeping” sensation, often feeling like it is originating in the lower legs, but often associated with aches and pains throughout the legs. This often causes difficulty initiating sleep and is relieved by movement of the leg, such as walking or kicking. Abnormalities in the neurotransmitter dopamine have often been associated with RLS. Healthcare providers often combine a medication to help correct the underlying dopamine abnormality along with a medicine to promote sleep continuity in the treatment of RLS.</p>\r\r<h3>Sleep Apnea</h3>\r\r<p>Snoring may be more than just an annoying habit—it may be a sign of sleep apnea. Persons with sleep apnea characteristically make periodic gasping or “snorting” noises, during which their sleep is momentarily interrupted. Those with sleep apnea may also experience excessive daytime sleepiness, as their sleep is commonly interrupted and may not feel restorative. Treatment of sleep apnea is dependent on its cause. If other medical problems are present, such as <i>congestive heart failure</i> or nasal obstruction, sleep apnea may resolve with treatment of these conditions. Gentle air pressure administered during sleep (typically in the form of a nasal <i>continuous positive airway pressure</i> [CPAP] device) may also be effective in the treatment of sleep apnea. As interruption of regular breathing or obstruction of the airway during sleep can pose serious health complications, symptoms of sleep apnea should be taken seriously. Treatment should be sought from a health care provider.</p>', 4, 244, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(566, 'ms0107_05', '<h2>Sleep and Chronic Disease</h2><p>As chronic diseases have assumed an increasingly common role in premature death and illness, interest in the role of sleep health in the development and management of chronic diseases has grown. Notably, insufficient sleep has been linked to the development and management of a number of chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression.</p>\r\r<h3>Diabetes</h3>\r\r<p>Research has found that insufficient sleep is linked to an increased risk for the development of Type 2 diabetes. Specifically, sleep duration and quality have emerged as predictors of levels of hemoglobin A1c, an important marker of blood sugar control. Recent research suggests that optimizing sleep duration and quality may be important means of improving blood sugar control in persons with Type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\r<h3>Cardiovascular Disease</h3>\r\r<p>Persons with sleep apnea have been found to be at increased risk for a number of cardiovascular diseases. Notably, hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and arrhythmias have been found to be more common among those with disordered sleep than their peers without sleep abnormalities. Likewise, sleep apnea and atherosclerosis appear to share some common physiological characteristics, further suggesting that sleep apnea may be an important predictor of cardiovascular disease.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:797}}</p>\r\r<h3>Obesity</h3>\r\r<p>Laboratory research has found that short sleep duration results in metabolic changes that may be linked to obesity. Epidemiologic studies conducted in the community have also revealed an association between short sleep duration and excess body weight. This association has been reported in all age groups—but has been particularly pronounced in children. It is believed that sleep in childhood and adolescence is particularly important for brain development and that insufficient sleep in youngsters may adversely affect the function of a region of the brain known as the hypothalamus, which regulates appetite and the expenditure of energy.</p>\r\r<h3>Depression</h3>\r\r<p>The relationship between sleep and depression is complex. While sleep disturbance has long been held to be an important symptom of depression, recent research has indicated that depressive symptoms may decrease once sleep apnea has been effectively treated and sufficient sleep restored. The interrelatedness of sleep and depression suggests it is important that the sleep sufficiency of persons with depression be assessed and that symptoms of depression be monitored among persons with a sleep disorder.</p>', 5, 168, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(567, 'ms0107_06', '<h2>A Growing Concern</h2><p>A growing number of American workers are not getting enough sleep. Research shows an increase from 24% in the 1980s to 30% in the 2000s in the percentage of American civilian workers reporting 6 or fewer hours of sleep per day—a level considered by sleep experts to be too short. An especially high prevalence of short sleep duration was reported by night shift workers in the transportation and warehousing (69.7%) and health-care and social assistance (52.3%) industries.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:798}}</p>\r\r<p>There are many reasons why we are not getting enough sleep, such as the demands at work. The timing of a shift can strain a worker’s ability to get enough sleep. Working at night or during irregular hours goes against the human body’s biology, which is hard-wired to sleep during the night and be awake and active during the day. Still, society needs certain workers around the clock to provide vital services in public safety, healthcare, utilities, food services, manufacturing, transportation, and others. The resulting shift work—any shift outside the normal daylight hours of 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.—is linked to poorer sleep, circadian rhythm disturbances, and strains on family and social life. It is not possible to eliminate shift work altogether, so the challenge is to develop strategies to make critical services available while keeping workers healthy and everyone around them safe. In addition to shift work, some data suggest that a growing number of employees are being asked to work long hours on a regular basis. Every extra hour on the job is one less spent attending to the person’s off-the-job responsibilities. When the day is too full to fit everything in, it is often sleep that gets the short shift.</p>\r\r<h3>Risks of Long Work Hours and Shift Work</h3>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<h4>Risks for Workers:</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Sleep deprivation\r<li>Lack of adequate time to recover from work\r<li>Decline in mental function and physical ability, including emotional fatigue and a decline in the function of the body’s immune system \r<li>Higher rates of depression, occupational injury, and poor perceived health\r<li>Higher prevalence of insomnia among shift workers with low social support\r<li>Increased risk of illness and injury\r<li>Strain on personal relationships, such as marriage and family life\r<li>Increased risk of long-term health effects, such as heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, mood disturbances, and cancer\r</ul></div>\n<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>Risks for Employers:</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Reduced productivity\r<li>Increase in errors\r<li>Absenteeism and presenteeism (present at work, but not fully functioning because of health problems or personal issues) \r<li>Increased health care and worker compensation costs\r<li>Workforce attrition due to disability, death, or moving to jobs with less demanding schedules\r<li>Risks to the Community\r<li>Potential increase in errors by workers leading to:\r<li>Medical errors\r<li>Vehicle crashes\r<li>Industrial disasters\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>Research indicates that the effect of long work hours and shift work may be more complex than a simple direct relationship between a certain high number of work hours or shift schedule and risks. The effects appear to be influenced by a variety of factors including characteristics of the worker and the job, worker control, pay, non-work responsibilities, and other characteristics of the work schedule.</p>\r\r<p>Both workers and employers share in the responsibility of reducing risks connected to poor sleep.

They also need to know how to protect other workers, such as by posting signs (e.g., "Wet - Slippery Floor") and reporting any unusual conditions.</p>\r\r<p>Housekeeping order is "maintained" not "achieved." Cleaning and organization must be done regularly, not just at the end of the shift. Integrating housekeeping into jobs can help ensure this is done. A good housekeeping program identifies and assigns responsibilities for the following:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Clean up during the shift\r<li>Day-to-day cleanup\r<li>Waste disposal\r<li>Removal of unused materials\r<li>Inspection to ensure cleanup is complete\r</ul></div>\r<p>Do not forget out-of-the-way places such as shelves, basements, sheds, and boiler rooms that would otherwise be overlooked. The orderly arrangement of operations, tools, equipment, and supplies is an important part of a good housekeeping program.</p>\r\r<p>The final addition to any housekeeping program is inspection. It is the only way to check for deficiencies in the program so that changes can be made. The documents on workplace inspection checklists provide a general guide and examples of checklists for inspecting offices and manufacturing facilities.</p>\r\r<h2 align="center">Elements of an Effective Housekeeping Program</h2>\r\r<h3>Cuts and Punctures</h3>\r\r<p>Cuts and punctures happen when people use everyday office supplies without exercising care.

Any of these items could cause a serious injury.\r<li>Do not pick up broken glass with your bare hands. Wear gloves and use a broom and a dustpan.\r<li>Place used blades, broken glass, or other sharp objects in a rigid container, such as a box, before disposing in a wastebasket.\r</ul></div>', 3, 184, 1, NULL, NULL),

Vacuum cleaners are suitable for removing light dust and dirt. Industrial models have special fittings for cleaning walls, ceilings, ledges, machinery, and other hard-to-reach places where dust and dirt may accumulate.</p>\r\r<p>Special-purpose vacuums are useful for removing hazardous substances. For example, vacuum cleaners fitted with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters may be used to capture fine particles of asbestos or fiberglass.</p>\r\r<p>Dampening (wetting) floors or using sweeping compounds before sweeping reduces the amount of airborne dust. The dust and grime that collect in places like shelves, piping, conduits, light fixtures, reflectors, windows, cupboards, and lockers may require manual cleaning.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:803}}</p>\r\r<p>Compressed air should <u>not</u> be used for removing dust, dirt, or chips from equipment or work surfaces.</p>\r\r<h3>Employee Facilities</h3>\r\r<p>Employee facilities need to be adequate, clean, and well maintained. Lockers are necessary for storing employees\' personal belongings. Washroom facilities require cleaning once or more each shift. They also need to have a good supply of soap, towels, plus disinfectants, if needed. Paper should not be permitted to litter the floor.</p>\r\r<p>Never light a candle or use air fresheners to eliminate odors in a rest room. Candles have an open flame and air fresheners can “trigger” allergic attacks for some employees.</p>\r\r<p>If workers are using hazardous materials, employee facilities should provide special precautions such as showers, washing facilities, and change rooms. Some facilities may require two locker rooms with showers between. Using such double locker rooms allows workers to shower off workplace contaminants and prevents them from contaminating their "street clothes" by keeping their work clothes separated from the clothing that they wear home.</p>\r\r<p>Smoking, eating, or drinking in the work area should be prohibited where toxic materials are handled. The eating area should be separate from the work area and should be cleaned properly each shift.</p>\r\r<h3>Kitchen, Coffee Area, and Food</h3>\r\r<p>Dirt, grime, and garbage, if left to accumulate, can create health hazards and spread disease. Have sufficient trash receptacles located in kitchens, break rooms, and other locations where food is consumed. Kitchens and coffee preparation areas need to be clean and floors maintained. Spills on the counters or floors need to be mopped up promptly. Injuries can be sustained from slips and falls on wet floors.</p>\r\r<p>Kitchen and coffee preparation area counters need to be clean and free from spills and grime. Refrigerators should be cleaned out at least once a week, and stoves/microwaves need to be wiped down after each use.</p>\r\r<p>Trash must be properly disposed on a daily basis to avoid attracting insects, mice, rats, and other vermin. Rotting food, even in a refrigerator, is a health hazard. Staff should be discouraged from consuming food in places that are not specifically designated for food consumption. If staff consumes food at their desks, the food waste should be disposed in appropriate receptacles to avoid attracting mice, rats, and other vermin.</p>\r\r<h3>Surfaces</h3>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<h4>Floors:</h4>\n\n<p>Poor floor conditions are a leading cause of accidents, so cleaning up spilled oil and other liquids at once is important. Allowing chips, shavings, and dust to accumulate can also cause accidents. Trapping chips, shavings, and dust before they reach the floor or cleaning them up regularly can prevent their accumulation. Areas that cannot be cleaned continuously, such as entranceways, should have anti-slip flooring. Keeping floors in good order also means replacing any worn, ripped, or damaged flooring that poses a tripping hazard.</p>\r\r<h4>Walls:</h4>\n<p> Light-colored walls reflect light while dirty or dark-colored walls absorb light. Contrasting colors warn of physical hazards and mark obstructions such as pillars. Paint can highlight railings, guards and other safety equipment, but should never be used as a substitute for guarding. The program should outline the regulations and standards for colors.</p></div>', 4, 280, 1, NULL, NULL),

When employees need to access the office after dark, the entry should be well lit. Main office walkway lighting should be on or be motion activated during evening hours. A preventative maintenance program should be established to assure burnt out bulbs are promptly attended to.</p>\r\r<h3>Space Heaters </h3>\r\r<p>The use of portable electric space heaters should always be a last resort.

When used improperly though, space heaters are an accident waiting to happen. They can cause fires, electric shocks, and can reduce oxygen levels. Fuel fired space heaters (e.g., natural gas, kerosene, propane, fuel oil, etc.) are prohibited in office settings. The following apply when using portable electric space heaters:</p>\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Use only for the purpose for which they are designed (refer to manufacturer\'s labeling and recommendations)\r<li>The space heater must have devices that automatically turn it off if tipped over and when the room is warmed.\r<li>Keep the heater in a stable, upright position with at least 30 inches of space between the front of the unit and any other surface.\r<li>Never operate the heater in a closed area, such as beneath furniture, in cabinets, beneath/behind curtains, drapes, or other combustibles (i.e., paper, cardboard, etc.). Never hang a portable heater from a wall or ceiling.\r<li>Check the cord to make sure it is not frayed or worn.\r<li>Always plug heater into a surge protector or its own outlet.\r<li>Always unplug heaters when they are not in use.\r<li>Do not overload electrical circuits.\r<li>Never touch an electric heater if your hands are wet or if you are in contact with water.\r</ul></div>\r<h3>Aisles and Stairways</h3>\r\r<p>Aisles should be wide enough to accommodate people and vehicles comfortably and safely. Aisle space allows for the movement of people, products, and materials. Warning signs and mirrors can improve sight lines in blind corners. Arranging aisles properly encourages people to use them so that they do not take shortcuts through hazardous areas.</p>\r\r<p>Keeping aisles and stairways clear is important. They should not be used for temporary "overflow" or "bottleneck" storage. Stairways and aisles also require adequate lighting.</p>\r\r<h3>Spill Control </h3>\r\r<p>The best way to control spills is to stop them before they happen. Regularly cleaning and maintaining machines and equipment is one way. Another is to use drip pans and guards where possible spills might occur. When spills do occur, it is important to clean them up immediately. Absorbent materials are useful for wiping up greasy, oily, or other liquid spills. Used absorbents must be disposed of properly and safely.</p>', 5, 199, 1, NULL, NULL),

Maintenance involves keeping buildings, equipment, and machinery in safe, efficient working order and in good repair. This includes maintaining sanitary facilities and regularly painting and cleaning walls. Broken windows, damaged doors, defective plumbing, and broken floor surfaces can make a workplace look neglected; these conditions can cause accidents and affect work practices, so it is important to replace or fix broken or damaged items as quickly as possible. A good maintenance program provides for the inspection, maintenance, upkeep, and repair of tools, equipment, machines, and processes.</p>\r\r<h3>Waste Disposal</h3>\r\r<p>The regular collection, grading, and sorting of scrap contribute to good housekeeping practices. It also makes it possible to separate materials that can be recycled from those going to waste disposal facilities.</p>\r\r<p>Allowing material to build up on the floor wastes time and energy since additional time is required for cleaning it up.

As antigenic changes accumulate, the antibodies created against the older viruses no longer recognize the “newer” virus, and the person can get sick again. Genetic changes that result in a virus with different antigenic properties is the main reason why people can get the flu more than one time. This is also why the flu vaccine composition must be reviewed each year, and updated as needed to keep up with evolving viruses.</p>\r\r<p>The other type of change is called “antigenic shift.” Antigenic shift is an abrupt, major change in influenza A viruses, resulting in new hemagglutinin and/or new hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins in influenza viruses that infect humans.

The flu can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have the flu, and people with chronic congestive heart failure may experience worsening of this condition that is triggered by the flu.</p>\r\r<h3>People at High Risk from Flu</h3>\r\r<p>Anyone can get the flu (even healthy people), and serious problems related to the flu can happen at any age, but some people are at high risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick.

	(600, 'ds-j09_06', '<h2>Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Influenza</h2><p>Influenza viruses are spread from person to person primarily through large-particle respiratory droplet transmission (e.g., when an infected person coughs or sneezes near a susceptible person). Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only a short distance (less than or equal to 1 meter) through the air. Contact with respiratory-droplet contaminated surfaces is another possible source of transmission. Airborne transmission (via small-particle residue [less than or equal to 5µm] of evaporated droplets that might remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) also is thought to be possible, although data supporting airborne transmission are limited. The typical incubation period for influenza is 1 to 4 days (average: 2 days). Adults shed influenza virus from the day before symptoms begin through 5 to 10 days after illness onset. However, the amount of virus shed, and presumably infectivity, decreases rapidly by 3 to 5 days after onset in an experimental human infection model. Young children also might shed the virus several days before illness onset, and children can be infectious for 10 or more days after onset of symptoms. Severely immunocompromised persons can shed the virus for weeks or months.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:830}}</p>\r\r<p>Uncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional and respiratory signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis). Among children, otitis media, nausea, and vomiting also are commonly reported with influenza illness. Uncomplicated influenza illness typically resolves after 3-7 days for the majority of persons, although cough and malaise can persist for >2 weeks. However, influenza virus infections can cause primary influenza viral pneumonia; exacerbate underlying medical conditions (e.g., pulmonary or cardiac disease); lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinusitis, or otitis media; or contribute to coinfections with other viral or bacterial pathogens. Young children with influenza virus infection might have initial symptoms mimicking bacterial sepsis with high fevers, and febrile seizures have been reported in 6%-20% of children hospitalized with influenza virus infection. Population-based studies among hospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed influenza have demonstrated that although the majority of hospitalizations are brief (2 or fewer days), 4%-11% of children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza required treatment in the intensive care unit, and 3% required mechanical ventilation. Among 1,308 hospitalized children in one study, 80% were aged <5 years, and 27% were aged <6 months. Influenza virus infection also has been uncommonly associated with encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, myositis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and Reye\'s syndrome.</p>\r\r<p>Respiratory illnesses caused by influenza virus infection are difficult to distinguish from illnesses caused by other respiratory pathogens on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Sensitivity and predictive value of clinical definitions vary, depending on the prevalence of other respiratory pathogens and the level of influenza activity. Among generally healthy older adolescents and adults living in areas with confirmed influenza virus circulation, estimates of the positive predictive value of a simple clinical definition of influenza (acute onset of cough and fever) for laboratory-confirmed influenza infection have varied (range: 79%-88%).</p>\r\r<p>Young children are less likely to report typical influenza symptoms (e.g., fever and cough). In studies conducted among children aged 5-12 years, the positive predictive value of fever and cough together was 71%-83%, compared with 64% among children aged <5 years. In one large, population-based surveillance study in which all children with fever or symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection were tested for influenza, 70% of hospitalized children aged <6 months with laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported to have fever and cough, compared with 91% of hospitalized children aged 6 months-5 years. Among children who subsequently were shown to have laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, only 28% of those hospitalized and 17% of those treated as outpatients had a discharge diagnosis of influenza.</p>\r\r<p>Clinical definitions have performed poorly in some studies of older patients. A study of non-hospitalized patients aged 60 years and older indicated that the presence of fever, cough, and acute onset had a positive predictive value of 30% for influenza. Among hospitalized patients aged 65 years and older with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, a combination of fever, cough, and illness of <7 days had a positive predictive value of 53% for confirmed influenza infection. In addition, the absence of symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) does not effectively rule out influenza; among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed infection in two studies, 44%-51% had typical ILI symptoms. A study of vaccinated older persons with chronic lung disease reported that cough was not predictive of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection, although having both fever or feverishness and myalgia had a positive predictive value of 41%. These results highlight the challenges of identifying influenza illness in the absence of laboratory confirmation and indicate that the diagnosis of influenza should be considered in patients with respiratory symptoms or fever during influenza season.</p>\r\r<p>Appropriate treatment of patients with respiratory illness depends on accurate and timely diagnosis. Early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics and provide the option of using antiviral therapy. However, because certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms similar to influenza, bacterial infections should be considered and appropriately treated, if suspected. In addition, bacterial infections can occur as a complication of influenza.</p>', 6, 422, 1, NULL, NULL),

No sustained person-to-person spread of the H7N9 virus has been found at this time.</p>\r\r<p>Human infections with avian influenza (AI, or “bird flu”) are rare but do occur, most commonly after exposure to infected poultry (Bird-to-human spread). Limited person-to-person spread of bird flu is thought to have occurred rarely in the past, most notably with avian influenza A (H5N1). Based on this previous experience, some limited human-to-human spread of this H7N9 virus would not be surprising.

CDC is following this situation closely and coordinating with domestic and international partners. CDC takes routine preparedness actions whenever a new virus with pandemic potential is identified, including developing a candidate vaccine virus to make a vaccine if it were to be needed. CDC also has issued guidance to clinicians and public health authorities in the United States, as well as provided information for people traveling to China. This is an evolving situation and there is still much to learn. CDC will provide updated information as it becomes available.</p>', 8, 216, 1, NULL, NULL),

Six countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, have widespread and ongoing infections in their poultry. Poultry outbreaks have occurred in other countries recently as well.</p>\r\r<p>Human infection with H5N1 is rare. Most infections occurred after direct or close contact with poultry infected with H5N1.

Avian influenza A virus infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the nose or throat of the sick person during the first few days of illness. This specimen is sent to a lab; the laboratory looks for avian influenza A virus either by using a molecular test, by trying to grow the virus, or both. Growing avian influenza A viruses should only be done in laboratories with high levels of protection.</p>\r\r<p>For critically ill patients, collection and testing of lower respiratory tract specimens may lead to diagnosis of HPAI H5N1 virus. For some patients who are no longer very sick or who have fully recovered, it may be difficult to find the avian influenza A virus in the specimen that was collected using these methods. Sometimes it may still be possible to diagnose avian influenza A virus infection by looking for evidence of the body\'s immune response to the virus infection by detecting specific antibodies the body has produced in response to the virus. This is not always an option because it requires two blood specimens (one taken during the first week of illness and another taken 3 to 4 weeks later). Also, it can take several weeks to verify the results, and testing must be performed in a special laboratory, such as at CDC.</p>\r\r<p>Other subtypes of avian influenza A viruses also have infected humans, including both low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A viruses. Public health authorities closely monitor cases of human illness associated with avian influenza A virus infections because of concerns about the potential for more widespread infections and transmission in humans. The spread of avian influenza A viruses from one ill person to another through prolonged, unprotected, close contact has been reported very rarely, and has been limited, inefficient, and not sustained. However, because avian influenza A viruses have the potential to change and gain the ability to spread easily among people, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person transmission is extremely important for public health.</p>\r\r<h3>H5N1 Prevention</h3>\r\r<p>The best way to prevent infection is to avoid any contact with sick or dead poultry. This includes avoiding visiting live poultry markets that may be infected with H5N1 when traveling. Also avoid sick people who might have H5N1 virus infection in affected countries.</p>\r\r<p>The United States government carefully controls domestic and imported food products. The U.S. bans poultry and poultry product imported from countries whose poultry are infected by certain bird flu viruses, including H5N1.</p>\r\r<p>You cannot get highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infection from properly handled and cooked poultry and eggs. When preparing poultry or eggs:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw poultry or eggs\r<li>Clean cutting boards and other utensils with soap and water to keep raw poultry from contaminating other foods.\r<li>Use a food thermometer to make sure you cook poultry to a temperature of at least 165 °F.\r<li>Cook eggs until whites and yolks are firm.\r</ul>\n</div>\r<p>Thailand has begun a phase 1 clinical trial to test an H5N1 avian, or bird, influenza vaccine in a needle-free, nasal spray form.

The Influenza Division and its partners are committed to reducing the threat of influenza and other emerging diseases globally.</p>\r\r<h2>Influenza Risk Assessment Tool</h2>\r\r<p>The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) is an evaluation tool being developed by CDC and external influenza experts that seek to assess the potential pandemic risk posed by influenza A viruses that currently circulate in animals but not in humans. The IRAT makes an assessment of potential pandemic risk based on two different scenarios: “emergence” and “public health impact.”</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:836}}</p>\r\r<p>“Emergence” refers to the risk of a novel (i.e., new in humans) influenza virus acquiring the ability to spread easily and efficiently in people. “Public health impact” refers to the potential severity of human disease caused by the virus (e.g., deaths and hospitalizations) as well as the burden on society (e.g., missed workdays, strain on hospital capacity and resources, and interruption of basic public services) if a novel influenza virus began spreading efficiently and sustainably among people.</p>\r\r<p>Ten scientific criteria are used to measure the potential pandemic risk associated with each of these scenarios. These 10 criteria can be grouped into three overarching categories: “properties of the virus,” “attributes of the population,” and “ecology & epidemiology of the virus.” Influenza subject matter experts will evaluate novel influenza viruses based on each of these 10 criteria. Each of the 10 criteria is then weighted statistically based on its significance to each of the two scenarios. A composite score for each virus is then calculated based on the given scenario. These composite scores provide a means to rank and compare influenza viruses to each other in terms of their potential pandemic risk for each of the two scenarios.</p>\r\r<p>As we learn more about influenza A viruses, these 10 criteria may change, other criteria may be added, or some current criteria may be dropped. The IRAT is designed to be flexible and responsive to current scientific advances.</p>\r\r<p>The IRAT is intended to do the following:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness by helping to determine which novel (new) influenza viruses to develop vaccines against and capitalizing on surveillance efforts and in-country capacity building activities;\r<li>Identify key gaps in information and knowledge that can be the basis to prompt additional studies. (For example, if information is not available for one of the 10 criteria used by the IRAT additional studies could be done or resources allocated to provide the needed information);\r<li>Document in a transparent manner the data and scientific process used to inform management decisions associated with pandemic preparedness;\r<li>Provide a flexible means to easily and regularly update the risk assessment of novel influenza viruses as new information becomes available;\r<li>Be an effective communications tool for policy makers and the influenza community;\r<li>Provide a means to weigh the 10 evaluation criteria differently depending on whether the intent of the risk assessment is to measure the ability of an influenza virus to “emerge” as a pandemic capable virus (i.e., become capable of efficient human-to-human spread) or “impact” the human population if it did emerge.\r</ul>\n</div>\r<p>The IRAT cannot predict the next pandemic and is not intended to do so. Furthermore, the IRAT is not intended to eliminate the need for subject matter expertise. In fact, subject matter experts are needed to carefully analyze the 10 criteria of the IRAT to make determinations of pandemic risk and to rank the importance of the criteria according to the specific risk question or situation. Lastly, the IRAT is not intended to make exact risk estimates. For example, many risk assessments generate a quantitative measure that describes the likelihood of exposure or disease risk. The IRAT focuses on the perceived pandemic potential of novel influenza viruses as estimated by subject matter experts using the IRAT evaluation criteria and available data.

	(608, 'ds-j09_14', '<h2>Laboratory Diagnostic Procedures</h2><p>A number of tests can help in the diagnosis of influenza. But, tests do not need to be done on all patients. For individual patients, tests are most useful when they are likely to give a doctor results that will help with diagnosis and treatment decisions. During a respiratory illness outbreak in a closed setting (e.g. hospitals, nursing home, cruise ship, boarding school, summer camp) however, testing for influenza can be very helpful in determining if influenza is the cause of the outbreak.</p>\r\r<p>Preferred respiratory samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and nasal wash or aspirate, depending on which type of test is used. Samples should be collected within the first 4 days of illness. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests provide results within 15 minutes or less; viral culture provides results in 3-10 days. Most of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests that can be done in a physician’s office are approximately 50-70% sensitive for detecting influenza and approximately greater than 90% specific. Therefore, false negative results are more common than false positive results, especially during peak influenza activity.</p>\r\r<p>Diagnostic tests available for influenza include viral culture, serology, rapid antigen testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence assays, and rapid molecular assays. Sensitivity and specificity of any test for influenza might vary by the laboratory that performs the test, the type of test used, and the type of specimen tested. Among respiratory specimens for viral isolation or rapid detection, nasopharyngeal specimens are typically more effective than throat swab specimens. As with any diagnostic test, results should be evaluated in the context of other clinical and epidemiologic information available to healthcare providers.</p>\r\r<h3>Viral Culture</h3>\r\r<p>Despite the availability of rapid influenza diagnostic tests, collecting clinical specimens for viral culture is critical, because only culture isolates can provide specific information regarding circulating strains and subtypes of influenza viruses. This information is needed to compare current circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains, to guide decisions regarding influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and to formulate vaccines for the coming year. Virus isolates also are needed to monitor the emergence of antiviral resistance and the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes that might pose a pandemic threat.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:837}}</p>\r\r<p>During outbreaks of respiratory illness when influenza is suspected, some respiratory samples should be tested by both rapid influenza diagnostic tests and by viral culture. The collection of some respiratory samples for viral culture is essential for determining the influenza A subtypes and influenza A and B strains causing illness, and for surveillance of new strains that may need to be included in the next year’s influenza vaccine. During outbreaks of influenza-like illness, viral culture also can help identify other causes of illness.</p>\r\r<h3>RIDTS</h3>\r\r<p>Commercial rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTS) are available that can detect influenza viruses within 15 minutes. Some tests are approved for use in any outpatient setting, whereas others must be used in a moderately complex clinical laboratory. These rapid influenza diagnostic tests differ in the types of influenza viruses they can detect and whether they can distinguish between influenza types. Different tests can detect 1) only influenza A viruses; 2) both influenza A and B viruses, but not distinguish between the two types; or 3) both influenza A and B and distinguish between the two.</p>\r\r<p>None of the tests provide any information about influenza A subtypes. The types of specimens acceptable for use (i.e., throat, nasopharyngeal, or nasal aspirates, swabs, or washes) also vary by test. The specificity and, in particular, the sensitivity of rapid influenza diagnostic tests are lower than for viral culture and vary by test. Because of the lower sensitivity of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests, physicians should consider confirming negative tests with viral culture or other means because of the possibility of false-negative rapid test results, especially during periods of peak community influenza activity. In contrast, false-positive rapid test results are less likely, but can occur during periods of low influenza activity. Therefore, when interpreting results of a rapid influenza diagnostic test, physicians should consider the positive and negative predictive values of the test in the context of the level of influenza activity in their community. Package inserts and the laboratory performing the test should be consulted for more details regarding use of rapid diagnostic tests.</p>\r\r<h3>Serologic Testing</h3>\r\r<p>Routine serological testing for influenza requires paired acute and convalescent sera, does not provide results to help with clinical decision-making, is only available at a limited number of public health or research laboratories and is not generally recommended, except for research and public health investigations. Serological testing results for human influenza on a single serum specimen is not interpretable and is not recommended.</p>', 14, 350, 1, NULL, NULL),

This guidance is not intended to apply to other settings whose primary purpose is not healthcare, such as schools or worksites, because many of the aspects of the populations and feasible countermeasures will differ substantially across settings. However, elements of this guidance may be applicable to specific sites within non-healthcare settings where care is routinely delivered (e.g. a medical clinic embedded within a workplace or school).</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:838}}</p>\r\r<p>For the purposes of this guidance, the <i>2008 Department of Health and Human Services definition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP)</i> will be used. Specifically, HCP refers to all persons, paid and unpaid, working in healthcare settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or to infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. HCP include, but are not limited to, physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual personnel, home healthcare personnel, and persons not directly involved in patient care (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, billing, chaplains, and volunteers) but potentially exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted to and from HCP and patients.

Promote and Administer Seasonal Influenza Vaccine:</h4>\r\r<p>Annual vaccination is the most important measure to prevent seasonal influenza infection. Achieving high influenza vaccination rates of HCP and patients is a critical step in preventing healthcare transmission of influenza from HCP to patients and from patients to HCP. According to current national guidelines, unless contraindicated, vaccinate all people aged 6 months and older, including HCP, patients, and residents of long-term care facilities.</p>\r\r<p>Systematic strategies employed by some institutions to improve HCP vaccination rates have included providing incentives, providing vaccines at no cost to HCP, improving access (e.g., offering vaccination at work and during work hours), requiring personnel to sign declination forms to acknowledge that they have been educated about the benefits and risks of vaccination, and mandating influenza vaccination for all HCP without contraindication. Many of these approaches have been shown to increase vaccination rates; tracking influenza vaccination coverage among HCP can be an important component of a systematic approach to protecting patients and HCP. Regardless of the strategy used, strong organizational leadership and an infrastructure for clear and timely communication and education, and for program implementation, have been common elements in successful programs.</p>\r</div>\n<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>2.

Adhere to Droplet Precautions:</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Droplet precautions should be implemented for patients with suspected or confirmed influenza for 7 days after illness onset or until 24 hours after the resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer, while a patient is in a healthcare facility. In some cases, facilities may choose to apply droplet precautions for longer periods based on clinical judgment, such as in the case of young children or severely immunocompromised patients, who may shed the influenza virus for longer periods of time.\r<li>Place patients with suspected or confirmed influenza in a private room or area. When a single patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting [i.e., grouping patients infected with the same infectious agents together to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with susceptible patients], keeping the patient with an existing roommate). For more information about making decisions on patient placement for droplet precautions, see CDC HICPAC Guidelines for Isolation Precautions (section V.C.2).\r<li>HCP should don a facemask when entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed influenza. Remove the facemask when leaving the patient\'s room, dispose of the facemask in a waste container, and perform hand hygiene.\n	<ul>\r<li>If some facilities and organizations opt to provide employees with alternative personal protective equipment, this equipment should provide the same protection of the nose and mouth from splashes and sprays provided by facemasks (e.g., face shields and N95 respirators or powered air purifying respirators).\n	</ul>\r<li>If a patient under droplet precautions requires movement or transport outside of the room:\n	<ul>\r<li>Have the patient wear a facemask, if possible, and follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and hand hygiene.\r<li>Communicate information about patients with suspected, probable, or confirmed influenza to appropriate personnel before transferring them to other departments in the facility (e.g., radiology, laboratory) or to other facilities.\n	</ul>\r<li>Patients under droplet precautions should be discharged from medical care when clinically appropriate, not based on the period of potential virus shedding or recommended duration of droplet precautions.

Use Caution when Performing Aerosol-Generating Procedures:</h4>\r\r<p>Some procedures performed on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza infection may be more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. These procedures potentially put HCP at an increased risk for influenza exposure. Although there are limited data available on influenza transmission related to such aerosols, many authorities recommend that additional precautions be used when such procedures are performed. These include some procedures that are usually planned ahead of time, such as bronchoscopy, sputum induction, elective intubation and extubation, and autopsies; and some procedures that often occur in unplanned, emergent settings and can be life-saving, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emergent intubation and open suctioning of airways. Ideally, a combination of measures should be used to reduce exposures from these aerosol-generating procedures when performed on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. However, it is appropriate to take feasibility into account, especially in challenging emergent situations, where timeliness in performing a procedure can be critical to achieving a good patient outcome. Precautions for aerosol-generating procedures include:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Only performing these procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza if they are medically necessary and cannot be postponed.\r<li>Limiting the number of HCP present during the procedure to only those essential for patient care and support. As is the case for all HCP, ensure that HCP whose duties require them to perform or be present during these procedures are offered influenza vaccination.\r<li>Conducting the procedures in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) when feasible. This will not be feasible for unplanned, emergent procedures, unless the patient is already in an AIIR. Such rooms are designed to reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and prevent their escape into adjacent areas using controlled air exchanges and directional airflow. They are single patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation.

During years when there is a good match between the flu vaccine and circulating viruses, it’s possible to measure substantial benefits from vaccination in terms of preventing flu illness.

	(622, 'ms0115_05', '<h2>Activities Associated with Needlestick Injuries</h2><p>Whenever a needle or other sharp device is exposed, injuries can occur. The circumstances leading to a needlestick injury depend partly on the type and design of the device used. For example, needle devices that must be taken apart or manipulated after use (e.g., prefilled cartridge syringes and phlebotomy needle/vacuum tube assemblies) are an obvious hazard and have been associated with increased injury rates. In addition, needles attached to a length of flexible tubing (e.g., winged-steel needles and needles attached to IV tubing) are sometimes difficult to place in sharps containers and thus present another injury hazard. Injuries involving needles attached to IV tubing may occur when a health care worker inserts or withdraws a needle from an IV port or tries to temporarily remove the needlestick hazard by inserting the needle into a drip chamber, IV port or bag, or even bedding.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:848}}</p>\r\r<p>In addition to the risks related to device characteristics, needlestick injuries have been related to certain work practices such as:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<h4>During Patient Care:</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Inserting or withdrawing a needle\r<li>Inserting needles into IV lines\r<li>Handling or passing sharps\r</ul>\r<h4>Immediately After Sharp Use:</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Recapping a used needle\r<li>Transferring or processing specimens\r</ul>\r<h4>During and After Sharp Disposal:</h4>\r<ul>\r<li>Disposing of sharps into proper containers\r<li>Cleaning up after a procedure\r<li>Sharps left on floors and tables, or found in linens, beds, or waste containers\r</ul>\n</div>\r<p>Past studies of needlestick injuries have shown that 10% to 25% occurred when recapping a used needle. Although recapping by hand has been discouraged for some time and is prohibited under the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard unless no alternative exists, 5% of needlestick injuries in NaSH hospitals are still related to this practice. Injury may occur when a health care worker attempts to transfer blood or other body fluids from a syringe to a specimen container (such as a vacuum tube) and misses the target. Also, if used needles or other sharps are left in the work area or are discarded in sharps containers that are not puncture resistant, a needlestick injury may result.</p>', 5, 145, 1, NULL, NULL),

However, other prevention strategy factors that must be addressed include modification of hazardous work practices, administrative changes to address needle hazards in the environment (e.g., prompt removal of filled sharps disposal boxes), safety education and awareness, feedback on safety improvements, and action taken on continuing problems. The critical role of appropriate training has been emphasized by several recent reports of increased patient bloodstream infections associated with improper care of needleless IV systems, primarily in the home health care setting.

However, if you don’t need extra ventilation, keep as much heat as possible inside your home. Avoid unnecessary opening of doors or windows. Close off unneeded rooms, stuff towels or rags in cracks under doors, and close draperies or cover windows with blankets at night.</p>\r\r<h3>Monitor Body Temperature</h3>\r\r<p>Infants less than one year old should never sleep in a cold room because (1) infants lose body heat more easily than adults; and (2) unlike adults, infants can’t make enough body heat by shivering. Provide warm clothing for infants and try to maintain a warm indoor temperature. If the temperature cannot be maintained, make temporary arrangements to stay elsewhere. In an emergency, you can keep an infant warm using your own body heat. If you must sleep, take precautions to prevent rolling on the baby. Pillows and other soft bedding can also present a risk of smothering; remove them from the area near the baby.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:861}}</p>\r\r<p>Older adults often make less body heat because of a slower metabolism and less physical activity. If you are over 65 years of age, check the temperature in your home often during severely cold weather. Also, check on elderly friends and neighbors frequently to ensure that their homes are adequately heated.</p>\r\r<h3>Keep a Water Supply</h3>\r\r<p>Extreme cold can cause water pipes in your home to freeze and sometimes rupture. When very cold temperatures are expected:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Leave all water taps slightly open so they drip continuously.\r<li>Keep the indoor temperature warm.\r<li>Improve the circulation of heated air near pipes. For example, open kitchen cabinet doors beneath the kitchen sink.\r</ul></div>\r<p>If your pipes do freeze, do not thaw them with a torch. Instead, thaw them slowly by directing the warm air from an electric hair dryer onto the pipes.</p>\r\r<p>If you cannot thaw your pipes, or the pipes are ruptured, use bottled water or get water from a neighbor’s home. As an emergency measure—if no other water is available—snow can be melted for water. Bringing water to a rolling boil for one minute will kill most microorganisms or parasites that may be present, but won’t remove chemical pollutants sometimes found in snow.</p>\r\r<h3>Eat and Drink Wisely</h3>\r\r<p>Eating well-balanced meals will help you stay warmer. Do not drink alcoholic or caffeinated beverages—they cause your body to lose heat more rapidly. Instead, drink warm, sweet beverages or broth to help maintain your body temperature. If you have any dietary restrictions, ask your doctor.</p>', 9, 170, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(636, 'ms0124_10', '<h2>Winter Weather: Outdoor Safety</h2><p>When the weather is extremely cold, and especially if there are high winds, try to stay indoors. Make any trips outside as brief as possible, and remember these tips below to protect your health and safety.</p>\r\r<h3>Dress Warmly and Stay Dry</h3>\r\r<p>Adults and children should wear:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>a hat\r<li>a scarf or knit mask to cover face and mouth\r<li>sleeves that are snug at the wrist\r<li>mittens (they are warmer than gloves)\r<li>water-resistant coat and boots\r<li>several layers of loose-fitting clothing\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>Be sure the outer layer of your clothing is tightly woven, preferably wind resistant, to reduce body-heat loss caused by wind. Wool, silk, or polypropylene inner layers of clothing will hold more body heat than cotton. Stay dry—wet clothing chills the body rapidly. Excess perspiration will increase heat loss, so remove extra layers of clothing whenever you feel too warm. Also, avoid getting gasoline or alcohol on your skin while de-icing and fueling your car or using a snow blower. These materials in contact with the skin greatly increase heat loss from the body. Do not ignore shivering. It’s an important first sign that the body is losing heat. Persistent shivering is a signal to return indoors.</p>\r\r<h3>Avoid Frostbite and Hypothermia</h3>\r\r<p>When exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced. Prolonged exposure to cold will eventually use up your body’s stored energy. The result is hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature. Body temperature that is too low affects the brain, making the victim unable to think clearly or move well. This makes hypothermia particularly dangerous because a person may not know it is happening and won’t be able to do anything about it.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:862}}</p>\r\r<p>Hypothermia occurs most likely at very cold temperatures, but it can occur even at cool temperatures (above 40 °F) if a person becomes chilled from rain, sweat, or submersion in cold water.</p>\r\r<p>Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. Frostbite causes a loss of feeling and color in affected areas. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, or toes. Frostbite can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation. The risk of frostbite is increased in people with reduced blood circulation and among people who are not dressed properly for extremely cold temperatures.</p>\r\r<h3>Avoid Exertion</h3>\r\r<p>Cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart. If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, follow your doctor’s advice about shoveling snow or performing other hard work in the cold. Otherwise, if you have to do heavy outdoor chores, dress warmly and work slowly. Remember, your body is already working hard just to stay warm, so don’t overdo it.</p>', 10, 189, 1, NULL, NULL),

The 1906 Act, which prohibited misbranded and adulterated food and drugs in interstate commerce, charged the Bureau of Chemistry to carry out its provisions.</p>\r\r<p>Eventually, the position of chief chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry evolved into that of the commissioner of food and drugs.</p>', 1, 164, 1, NULL, NULL),

Sleep apnea can affect people of all ages, including babies and children and particularly people over the age of forty and those who are overweight. Certain physical traits and clinical features are common in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. These include excessive weight, large neck, and structural abnormalities reducing the diameter of the upper airway, such as nasal obstruction, a low-hanging soft palate, enlarged tonsils, or a small jaw with an overbite.</p>\r\r<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) refers to sleep-disordered breathing due to the recurrent collapse of pharyngeal tissues resulting in snoring, fitful sleep, and daytime somnolence. These episodes are characterized by either reduced airflow (hypopnea), or a complete obstruction (apnea), with a subsequent drop in oxygen saturation, interfering with gas exchange. Obstructive sleep apnea is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality and is associated with hypertension, neuropsychological impairment, motor vehicle accidents, stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and decreased quality of life.

When their breathing pauses or becomes shallow, they’ll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep. As a result, the quality of their sleep is poor, which makes them tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.</p>\r\r<p>Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can\'t detect the condition during routine office visits.

Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can successfully treat sleep apnea in many people.\r\r<h2>Sleep Apnea Causes</h2>\r\r<p>When we’re awake, throat muscles help keep our airway stiff and open so air can flow into our lungs. When we sleep, these muscles relax, which narrows our throat. Normally, this narrowing doesn’t prevent air from flowing into and out of our lungs. But if an individual has sleep apnea, their airway can become partially or fully blocked because:\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ul>\r<li>Their throat muscles and tongue relax more than normal.\r<li>Their tongue and tonsils are large compared with the opening into their windpipe.\r<li>They’re overweight. The extra soft fat tissue can thicken the wall of the windpipe. This narrows the inside of the windpipe, which makes it harder to keep open.\r<li>The shape of their head and neck (bony structure) may cause a smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area.\r<li>The aging process limits their brain signals\' ability to keep their throat muscles stiff during sleep. Thus, their airway is more likely to narrow or collapse.\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>Not enough air flows into their lungs if their airway is partially or fully blocked during sleep. As a result, loud snoring and a drop in blood oxygen level can occur. If the oxygen drops to a dangerous level, it triggers the brain to disturb their sleep. This helps tighten the upper airway muscles and open their windpipe. Normal breathing then starts again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:874}}</p>\r\r<p>Frequent drops in blood oxygen levels and reduced sleep quality can trigger the release of stress hormones. These hormones raise an individual’s heart rate and increases their risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and arrhythmias. The hormones also can raise their risk for, or worsen, heart failure.</p>\r\r<p>Untreated sleep apnea also can lead to changes in how an individual’s body uses energy. These changes increase their risk for obesity and diabetes.</p>\r\r<h2>Risks for Sleep Apnea</h2>\r\r<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition. About half of the people who have this condition are overweight. Men are more likely than women to have sleep apnea. Although the condition can occur at any age, the risk increases as a person gets older. A family history of sleep apnea also increases the risk for the condition.</p>\r\r<p>People who have small airways in their noses, throats, or mouths are more likely to have sleep apnea. Small airways might be due to the shape of these structures or allergies or other conditions that cause congestion.</p>\r\r<p>Small children might have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats. Enlarged tonsil tissues raise a child’s risk for sleep apnea. Overweight children also might be at increased risk for sleep apnea.</p>\r\r<p>About half of the people who have sleep apnea also have high blood pressure. Sleep apnea also is linked to smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and risk factors for stroke and heart failure. Race and ethnicity might play a role in the risk of developing sleep apnea.

Their primary care doctor may evaluate their symptoms first. He or she will then decide whether they need to see a sleep specialist. Sleep specialists are doctors who diagnose and treat people who have sleep problems. Examples of such doctors include lung and nerve specialists and ear, nose, and throat specialists. Other types of doctors also can be sleep specialists.</p>\r\r<h3>Medical and Family Histories</h3>\r\r<p>If an individual thinks they have a sleep problem, consider having them keep a sleep diary for 1 to 2 weeks. Have them bring the diary with them to their next medical appointment. They write down when they go to sleep, wake up, and take naps. They also write down how much they sleep each night, how alert and rested they feel in the morning, and how sleepy they feel at various times during the day.

Often they’re not aware of such symptoms and must ask a family member or bed partner to report them. They should let their doctor know if anyone in their family has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or has had symptoms of the disorder. Many people aren\'t aware of their symptoms and aren\'t diagnosed. If they’re a parent of a child who may have sleep apnea, they need to tell their child\'s doctor about their child\'s signs and symptoms.</p>\r\r<h3>Physical Exam</h3>\r\r<p>An individual’s doctor will check their mouth, nose, and throat for extra or large tissues. Children who have sleep apnea might have enlarged tonsils. Doctors may need only a physical exam and medical history to diagnose sleep apnea in children. Adults who have sleep apnea may have an enlarged uvula or soft palate. The uvula is the tissue that hangs from the middle of the back of your mouth.

This study records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. A PSG also records the amount of oxygen in the blood, air movement through the nose while they breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether they’re making an effort to breathe.</p>\r\r<p>PSGs often are done at sleep centers or sleep labs. The test is painless.

A CPAP machine uses mild air pressure to keep airways open while a person sleeps.</p>\r\r<p>If an individual’s doctor thinks that they have sleep apnea, he or she may schedule a split-night sleep study. During the first half of the night, their sleep will be checked without a CPAP machine. This will show whether they have sleep apnea and how severe it is.

If an individual is having trouble with CPAP side effects, they need to work with their sleep specialist, his or her nursing staff, and the CPAP technician. Together, they can take steps to reduce the side effects.</p>\r\r<p>For example, the CPAP settings or size/fit of the mask might need to be adjusted. Adding moisture to the air as it flows through the mask or using nasal spray can help relieve a dry, stuffy, or runny nose. There are many types of CPAP machines and masks. CPAP users must tell their doctor if they’re not happy with the type they’re using. He or she may suggest switching to a different type that might work better for them. People who have severe sleep apnea symptoms generally feel much better once they begin treatment with CPAP.</p>\r\r<h3>CPAP</h3>\r\r<p>CPAP, or continuous positive airway pressure, is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep the airways open. CPAP typically is used by people who have breathing problems, such as sleep apnea. CPAP also may be used to treat preterm infants whose lungs have not fully developed. For example, doctors may use CPAP to treat infants who have respiratory distress syndrome or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</p>\r\r<p>CPAP treatment involves a CPAP machine, which has three main parts:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>A mask or other device that fits over the nose or the nose and mouth. Straps keep the mask in place while it’s being worn.\r<li>A tube that connects the mask to the machine\'s motor.\r<li>A motor that blows air into the tube.\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>Some CPAP machines have other features as well, such as heated humidifiers. CPAP machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise that they make is soft and rhythmic. CPAP often is the best treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while people sleep. As a result, not enough air reaches your lungs.</p>\r\r<p>In obstructive sleep apnea, the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. When an individual tries to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Their snoring may wake other people in the house. The mild pressure from CPAP can prevent the airways from collapsing or becoming blocked.</p>\r\r<p>If a doctor prescribes CPAP, they’ll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP machine. The patient’s doctor will work with them to make sure the settings that he or she prescribes for their CPAP machine are correct. He or she may recommend an overnight sleep study to find the correct settings. Their doctor will want to make sure the air pressure from the machine is just enough to keep their airway open while they sleep.</p>\r\r<p>CPAP also is used to treat preterm infants whose lungs have not fully developed. For this treatment, soft prongs are placed in an infant’s nostrils. The CPAP machine gently blows air into the baby\'s nose, which helps inflate his or her lungs.</p>', 8, 271, 1, NULL, NULL),

Research suggests that CPAP is an appropriate first treatment for some preterm newborns.</p>\r\r<h2>Surgery</h2>\r\r<p>Some people who have sleep apnea might benefit from surgery. The type of surgery and how well it works depend on the cause of the sleep apnea. Surgery is done to widen breathing passages. It usually involves shrinking, stiffening, or removing excess tissue in the mouth and throat or resetting the lower jaw.</p>\r\r<p>Surgery to shrink or stiffen excess tissue is done in a doctor\'s office or a hospital. Shrinking tissue may involve small shots or other treatments to the tissue. Individuals may need a series of treatments to shrink the excess tissue. To stiffen excess tissue, the doctor makes a small cut in the tissue and inserts a piece of stiff plastic.</p>\r\r<p>Surgery to remove excess tissue is done in a hospital. Individuals are given medicine to help them sleep during the surgery. After surgery, they may have throat pain that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.</p>\r\r<p>Surgery to remove the tonsils, if they\'re blocking the airway, might be helpful for some children. A child’s doctor may suggest waiting some time to see whether these tissues shrink on its own.

For example, this research has uncovered some of the causes of various sleep disorders and ways to diagnose and treat them.</p>\r\r<p>The NHLBI continues to support research to learn more about sleep and sleep disorders. For example, the NHLBI’s Sleep Heart Health Study showed that moderate to severe sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke and death in middle-aged adults, especially men.

The plan expands upon previous and current research programs and identifies new research opportunities.</p>\r\r<p>The NHLBI\'s National Center on Sleep Disorders Research coordinates this research across the NIH and other Federal agencies. The research focuses on sleep and the body\'s natural 24-hour cycle, the role of genes and the environment on sleep health, and ways to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep disorders.</p>\r\r<p>Much of this research depends on the willingness of volunteers to take part in clinical trials. Clinical trials test new ways to prevent, diagnose, or treat various diseases, conditions, and health problems. For example, new treatments for a disease or condition (such as medicines, medical devices, surgeries, or procedures) are tested in volunteers who have the illness. Testing shows whether a treatment is safe and effective in humans before it is made available for widespread use.</p>\r\r<p>By taking part in a clinical trial, an individual may gain access to new treatments before they\'re widely available. They also will have the support of a team of health care providers, who will likely monitor their health closely. Even if they don\'t directly benefit from the results of a clinical trial, the information gathered can help others and add to scientific knowledge.</p>\r\r<p>If an individual volunteers for a clinical trial, the research will be explained to them in detail. They’ll learn about treatments and tests they may receive, and the benefits and risks they may pose. They’ll also be given a chance to ask questions about the research. This process is called informed consent. If they agree to take part in the trial, they’ll be asked to sign an informed consent form. This form is not a contract. They have the right to withdraw from a study at any time, for any reason. Also, they have the right to learn about new risks or findings that emerge during the trial.</p>\r\r<p>For more information about clinical trials related to sleep apnea, sleep apnea patients should talk with their doctor.

Several projects rely on a mouse model of severe combined immunodeficiency (a group of inherited disorders that are characterized by a lack of or severe defect in cells responsible for protecting the immune system). This model allows researchers to transplant developing human brain tissue from culture into the brains of the mice to monitor and assess neurologic damage caused by HIV infection. Other studies use mice bred to carry symptoms of HIV, and NINDS grantees are using these animals to see if the brain can function as a sanctuary for HIV-infected cells that can migrate to and infect peripheral lymph tissue.</p>\r\r<p>The NINDS also supports research into the mechanisms of neurological illnesses related to immunodeficiency in AIDS patients. Several different investigators are studying the JC virus, which can reproduce in the brains of immunosuppressed patients and cause PML, and one study identified a novel receptor for the JC virus. Other studies of infectious agents include an investigation of the interaction of the fungal agent Cryptococcus with the blood vessels of the brain, and an analysis of neurosyphilis in people with AIDS.

Most can be cleaned with mild soap and water; never use abrasive soaps, rough paper, or cloth towels. Keep PPE in good working condition; if damaged, replace as soon as possible. Eye and face protection equipment that has been previously used should be disinfected before being issued to another employee. When employees are assigned protective equipment for extended periods, the equipment should be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Several methods for disinfecting eye-protective equipment are acceptable. The most effective method is to disassemble the goggles or spectacles and thoroughly clean all parts with soap and warm water.</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Carefully rinse all traces of soap and replace defective parts with new ones.\r<li>Swab thoroughly or completely and immerse all parts for 10 minutes in a solution of germicidal deodorant fungicide (cleans, disinfects, and deodorizes).\r<li>Remove parts from solution and suspend in a clean place for air-drying at room temperature or with heated air.\r<li>Do not rinse after removing parts from the solution because this will remove the germicidal residue that retains its effectiveness after drying.\r</ul></div>\n\r<p>The use of equipment with structural or optical defects is prohibited. Pitted lenses, like dirty lenses, can be a source of reduced vision. They should be replaced. Deeply scratched or excessively potted lenses are apt to break. Slack, worn-out, sweat-soaked, or twisted headbands do not hold the eye protector in proper position. Visual inspection can determine when the headband elasticity is reduced to a point below proper function.</p>\r\r<p>Store eye and face protection equipment in a sanitary, cool, dry area away from moisture and if possible, kept in the case when not in use. Items should be placed in a clean, dust-proof container, such as a box, bag, or plastic envelope, to protect them until reissue.

Also, employees whose work involves exposure to hot substances or corrosive or poisonous materials must have protective gear to cover exposed body parts, including legs and feet. If an employee’s feet may be exposed to electrical hazards, non-conductive footwear should be worn.

ASTM International sets the OSHA-approved standards for foot protection devices, and the current versions are ASTM F-2412-2005, "Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection," and ASTM F-2413-2005, "Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Protective Footwear.”</p>\r\r<p>ASTM footwear standards do <u>not</u> address some foot hazards, such as slip resistance, thermal insulating capability, resistance to chemical permeability and biological agents, and ankle support. Protective footwear for these types of hazards must be selected with good judgment and consideration given to specific site and use conditions.</p>\r\r<h3>Types of Foot Protection</h3>\r\r<p>All ASTM-approved footwear has a protective toe and offers impact and compression protection. But the type and amount of protection is <u>not</u> always the same. Different footwear protects in different ways. Check the product’s labeling or consult the manufacturer to make sure the footwear will protect the user from the hazards they face.</p>\r\r<p>Some of the most common types of foot protection used in the home healthcare industry include the following:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>Metatarsal Guards:</h4>\r\r<p>Metatarsal guards protect the instep area from impact and compression.

High-cut boots provide support against ankle injury.\r</ul></div>\n\r<h3>Donning and Doffing Foot PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Safety shoes should be worn as the manufacturer has specified. Boots should be laced all the way up and no alterations are allowed. Safety footwear should be fitted correctly and donned before performing an activity requiring foot PPE.</p>\r\r<p>When putting on shoe covers, make sure that all areas of the foot are covered and the shoe covers are snug. To remove shoe covers it is recommended that you sit down. Grasp the outside of the shoe cover and pull down and over your heel; pull it off your foot and dispose of it correctly. The exact way to remove the shoe covers will vary based on the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\r\r<h3>Limitations of Foot PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Safety shoes only protect the toes and not the instep or metatarsals; additional foot PPE must be worn for appropriate hazards. There are two ASTM classes of toe impact resistance: Class 50 provides protection against exposure to impact energy of 50 ft-lbf, which is approximately the force created by an item dropped directly on the toe weighing 50 pounds and dropped from a height of 12 inches; Class 75 provides protection against exposure to impact energy of 75 ft-lbf, which is approximately the force created by an object dropped directly on the toe weighing 50 lb. and dropped from a height of 18 inches.</p>\r\r<p>There are two ASTM classes of toe compression rating: Class 50 provides protection against exposure to a compressive force of 1750 lbf; Class 75 provides protection against exposure to a compressive force of 2500 lbf.</p>\r\r<p>These ASTM-certified shoes can provide a false sense of security and will not protect against all trauma that feet may be subjected to. A force generated by a falling or rolling compressed gas cylinder can easily exceed the protections of both Class 50 and Class 75 shoes.</p>\r\r<p>In addition, the soles of safety shoes may not provide resistance to slipping, which may cause injuries to other parts of the shoe wearer. Shoe covers are often slippery and can be a tripping hazard. Try to get well fitting covers with non-skid soles.</p>\r\r<h3>Care and Maintenance of Foot PPE</h3>\r\r<p>As with all protective equipment, safety footwear should be inspected prior to each use. Shoes should be checked for wear and tear at reasonable intervals. This includes looking for cracks or holes, separation of materials, or broken buckles or laces. The soles of shoes should be checked for pieces of metal or other embedded items that could present electrical or tripping hazards. Employees should follow the manufacturers’ recommendations for cleaning and maintenance of protective footwear.</p>\r\r<p>When working with chemicals, hose footwear with water to rinse away any chemicals or dirt before removing footwear. Store footwear in a clean, cool, dry, ventilated area.</p>\r \r<h3>Useful Life and Disposal of Foot PPE</h3>\r\r<p>There is no one-size-fits-all formula for knowing exactly when it’s time to replace safety shoes, as there are many variables to consider such as job hazards, how often the shoe/boot is worn, and the size and weight of the worker. Even within the same industry, the length of a safety shoe\'s service depends on the job task.</p>\r\r<p>A good rule of thumb, according to Fawn Evenson, Vice President of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, is "if there\'s any question that the shoe can no longer do what it was intended to do, then you should dispose of it."</p>\r\r<p>If any impact to a safety shoe causes a deformity to the protective toecaps, the shoe should be replaced. In cases of mild impact, the worker, a supervisor, and a division safety specialist should inspect the shoe. "Between the three of them, they would look at it and make a reasonable judgment call."</p>\r\r<p>The criteria for replacing shoes due to excessive wear and tear is subjective, but there are some red flags, such as when a shoe\'s steel toe or other protective components such as the steel midsole, the steel shank, or the metatarsal guard is showing.</p>\r\r<p>The National Safety Council, in its "Selection and User Guide for Protective Footwear," recommends immediately replacing impact- and compression-resistant shoes if there\'s "evidence of physical damage" to the toe area or the shoe. For shoes with metatarsal guards, shoes should be replaced after an impact has occurred or when the metatarsal guard is exposed from wear and tear, according to the guide.</p>\r\r<p>For waterproof or chemical-resistant footwear made with rubber or PVC materials, the recommendation is that boots be replaced immediately if there is any separation of the rubber or PVC parts, including the outsole, foxing (the piece of material that protects the joint between the outsole and the upper), or toe cover.</p>\r\r<p>The same could be said for evaluating the tread on a slip-resistant safety shoe. Once tread, or outsole, shows signs of damage or wear, the shoe likely is reaching retirement age. If an area of the shoe\'s tread is worn smooth or the tread design is not visible, then the need to replace the shoe becomes urgent, as the shoe isn\'t providing the slip protection it was purchased for.</p>', 8, 387, 1, NULL, NULL),

Tools and machines with sharp edges can cut hands or arms. Coming into contact with caustic or toxic chemicals, biological substances, electrical sources, or extremely cold or hot objects can irritate, burn, or contaminate hands or arms. Whenever the same hand movements are repeated over a long period of time, the risk of repetitive motion problems increases.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:911}}</p>\r\r<h3>Using/Wearing Hand & Arm PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Select and use the right kind of glove for the job that is going to be performed. Check the fit; always use the correct size. Make sure they are chemical resistant to the chemical being used. If you are allergic to latex or the powder inside most gloves, make sure you select an appropriate and safe alternative.</p>\r \r<p>Always inspect protective gloves before use. Remove any rings, watches, or bracelets that might cut or tear gloves. Inspect gloves for holes and cracks that might leak or make gloves ineffectual. Replace gloves that are worn or torn.</p>\r \r<p>Gloves protect against contact with infectious materials. However, once contaminated, gloves can become a means for spreading infectious materials to you, other patients, or environmental surfaces. Therefore, the way gloves are used can influence the risk of disease transmission in your healthcare setting. These are the most important things to keep in mind while using gloves.</p>\r \r<p>Always work from clean to dirty! This is a basic principle of infection control. In this instance, it refers to touching clean body sites or surfaces before you touch dirty or heavily contaminated areas.</p>\r \r<p>Limit opportunities for “touch contamination.” How many times have you seen someone adjust their glasses, rub their nose, or touch their face with gloves that have been in contact with a patient? These are examples of “touch contamination” that can potentially expose individuals to infectious agents. Think about environmental surfaces too and avoid unnecessarily touching them with contaminated gloves. Surfaces such as light switches and door and cabinet knobs can become contaminated if touched by soiled gloves.</p>\r \r<h3>Donning and Doffing Hand & Arm PPE</h3>\r\r<p>If multiple types of PPE are needed, gloves are donned last. Select the correct type and size of gloves. Insert hands into non-sterile gloves and if applicable, extend gloves over isolation gown cuffs and adjust as needed for comfort and dexterity. Donning sterile gloves requires a specific aseptic technique and is not covered in this course.</p>\r\r<p>When removing gloves, remember, the outsides of gloves are contaminated.

Gloves that are discolored or stiff may also indicate deficiencies caused by excessive use or degradation from chemical exposure.</p>\r\r<p>Any gloves with impaired protective ability should be discarded and replaced. Reuse of chemical-resistant gloves should be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration the absorptive qualities of the gloves. A decision to reuse chemically-exposed gloves should take into consideration the toxicity of the chemicals involved and factors such as duration of exposure, storage, and temperature.</p>\r\r<h3>Useful Life and Disposal of Hand & Arm PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Disposable (single use) gloves such as surgical or examination gloves must be replaced as soon as practical when contaminated or as soon as feasible if they are torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Disposable (single use) gloves will not be washed or decontaminated for re-use. Always change gloves after use on each patient, and discard them in the nearest appropriate receptacle.</p>\r\r<p>Utility gloves may be decontaminated for re-use if the integrity of the glove is not compromised.

Hearing protectors worn by employees must reduce an employee’s noise exposure to within the acceptable limits noted in the above table.</p>\r\r<p>It is not necessary for every employer to measure workplace noise. Noise monitoring or measuring must be conducted only when exposures are at or above 85 dB. Factors that suggest that noise exposures in the workplace may be at this level include employee complaints about the loudness of noise, indications that employees are losing their hearing, or noisy conditions which make normal conversation difficult. The employer should also consider any information available regarding noise emitted from specific machines.

They are available in different shapes and sizes and can be custom made. An earplug must be snugly fitted so that it seals the entire circumference of the ear canal. An improperly fitted, dirty, or worn-out plug will not seal and can irritate the ear canal.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:913}}</p>\r\r<p>Earmuffs fit over the entire outer ear—they will not fit properly over glasses or long hair—and are held in place by an adjustable headband. The headband must hold the earmuff firmly around the ear.</p>\r\r<p>Better earplugs and earmuffs are about equal in sound reduction, though earplugs are more effective for reducing low-frequency noise and earmuffs for reducing high-frequency noise. Using earplugs and earmuffs together increases protection against higher noise levels (above 105 decibels) than either used alone.</p>\r\r<h3>Donning and Doffing Hearing PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Donning disposable earplugs includes washing hands, and rolling and compressing the earplug into a point. Reach over your head and pull the ear up and back and insert the plug into the ear and hold in place until it expands.</p>\r\r<p>Donning reusable earplugs includes washing hands, reaching over your head and pulling the ear up and back and inserting the plug into the ear. For headband types, gently pull apart, and release the plugs into the ears.</p>\r\r<p>Donning earmuffs includes pushing hair away from the ears, placing cushions over the ears, and pressing the cushions to create a seal around the ears. Wear the headband over the top of your head, not around your neck.</p>\r\r<h3>Limitations of Hearing PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Earplugs in general provide less protection than some earmuffs, and should not be used in areas having noise levels over 105 dB(A) (A-weighted decibels). Earplugs are not as visible as earmuffs and a supervisor cannot readily check to see if workers are wearing them. Earplugs must be properly inserted to provide adequate protection. Discard if foam earplugs do not expand to fill ear canal.</p>\r\r<p>Earmuffs are less comfortable than earplugs, especially in hot work areas. Earmuffs are less portable and heavier and may be more inconvenient for use with other personal protective equipment. Earmuffs may interfere with the wearing of safety or prescription glasses; wearing glasses results in breaking the seal between the earmuff and the skin and results in decreased hearing protection.</p>\r\r<h3>Care and Maintenance of Hearing PPE</h3>\r\r<p>Disposable earplugs should be discarded if dirty or after each use. Reusable earplugs should be washed in soap and water and discarded if torn, warped, or if the headband breaks. Squeeze excess moisture from the earplugs or cushions and then place them on a clean surface to air dry. (Check the manufacturer\'s recommendations first to find out if the earplugs are washable.) Banded earplugs should have their pods replaced every 2-4 weeks to ensure optimal protection and performance.</p>\r\r<p>Earmuffs should be cleaned with a damp cloth and soap and inspected regularly for wear and tear. Earmuffs should be disassembled to clean. Ensure that sound-attenuating material inside the ear cushions do not get wet. You should never modify the headband or cushions; replace the cushions if torn or no longer pliable or if the headband is bent. As ear cushions and foam inserts can degrade over time, replace these every 6-8 months under normal wear, or every 3-4 months with heavy use or in humid/extreme climates.</p>\r\r<h3>Useful Life and Disposal of Hearing PPE</h3>\r\r<p>When it comes to useful life and/or disposal, always follow the manufacturer\'s instructions.

The goal is to assign an EF Scale category based on the highest wind speed that occurred within the damage path. First, trained NWS personnel will identify the appropriate damage indicator (DI) from more than one of the 28 used in rating the damage. The construction or description of a building should match the DI being considered, and the observed damage should match one of the 8 degrees of damage (DOD) used by the scale. The tornado evaluator will then make a judgment within the range of upper and lower bound wind speeds, as to whether the wind speed to cause the damage is higher or lower than the expected value for the particular DOD. This is done for several structures, not just one, before a final EF rating is determined.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:922}}</p>\n\n<h2>Tornado Facts</h2>\r\r<p>Quick facts you should know about tornados:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>They may strike quickly, with little or no warning.\r<li>They may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel.\r<li>The average tornado moves southwest to northeast, but tornados have been known to move in any direction.\r<li>The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 mph, but may vary from stationary to 70 mph.\r<li>Tornados can accompany tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land.\r<li>Waterspouts are tornados that form over water.\r<li>Tornados are most frequently reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months.\r<li>Peak tornado season in the southern states is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer.\r<li>Tornados are most likely to occur between 3 pm and 9 pm, but can occur at any time.\r</ul>\n</div>', 2, 210, 1, NULL, NULL),

Among the most serious hazards are electrical burns and shocks.</p>\r\r<p>Electrical shocks, which can lead to injuries such as heart failure and burns, are among the major hazards associated with electric-powered tools. Under certain conditions, even a small amount of electric current can result in fibrillation of the heart and death. An electric shock also can cause the user to fall off a ladder or other elevated work surface and be injured due to the fall.</p>\r\r<p>To protect the user from shock and burns, electric tools must have a three-wire cord with a ground and be plugged into a grounded receptacle, be double insulated, or be powered by a low-voltage isolation transformer. Three-wire cords contain two current-carrying conductors and a grounding conductor. Any time an adapter is used to accommodate a two-hole receptacle, the adapter wire must be attached to a known ground. The third prong must never be removed from the plug.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:935}}</p>\r\r<p>Double-insulated tools are available that provide protection against electrical shock without third-wire grounding. On double-insulated tools, an internal layer of protective insulation completely isolates the external housing of the tool.</p>\r\r<p>The following general practices should be followed when using electric tools:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Operate electric tools within their design limitations.\r<li>Use gloves and appropriate safety footwear when using electric tools.\r<li>Store electric tools in a dry place when not in use.\r<li>Do not use electric tools in damp or wet locations unless they are approved for that purpose.\r<li>Keep work areas well lighted when operating electric tools.\r<li>Ensure that cords from electric tools do not present a tripping hazard.\r</ul>\n</div>', 4, 233, 1, NULL, NULL),

Abrasive wheel tools must be equipped with guards that: (1) cover the spindle end, nut, and flange projections; (2) maintain proper alignment with the wheel; and (3) do not exceed the strength of the fastenings.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:936}}</p>\r\r<p>Before an abrasive wheel is mounted, it must be inspected closely for damage and should be sound- or ring-tested to ensure that it is free from cracks or defects. To test, wheels should be tapped gently with a light, non-metallic instrument. If the wheels sound cracked or dead, they must not be used because they could fly apart in operation. A stable and undamaged wheel, when tapped, will give a clear metallic tone or "ring."</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:937}}</p>\r\r<p>To prevent an abrasive wheel from cracking, it must fit freely on the spindle. The spindle nut must be tightened enough to hold the wheel in place without distorting the flange. Always follow the manufacturer\'s recommendations. Take care to ensure that the spindle speed of the machine will not exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel.</p>\r\r<p>An abrasive wheel may disintegrate or explode during start-up. Allow the tool to come up to operating speed prior to grinding or cutting. The employee should never stand in the plane of rotation of the wheel as it accelerates to full operating speed. Portable grinding tools need to be equipped with safety guards to protect workers not only from the moving wheel surface, but also from flying fragments in case of wheel breakage.</p>\r\r<p>When using a powered grinder:</p>\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Always use eye or face protection.\r<li>Turn off the power when not in use.\r<li>Never clamp a hand-held grinder in a vise.\r</ul>\n</div>', 5, 121, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(693, 'ms0130_06', '<h3>Pneumatic Tools</h3><p>Pneumatic tools are powered by compressed air and include chippers, drills, hammers, and sanders. There are several dangers associated with the use of pneumatic tools. First and foremost is the danger of getting hit by one of the tool\'s attachments or by some kind of fastener the worker is using with the tool.</p>\r\r<p>Pneumatic tools must be checked to see that the tools are fastened securely to the air hose to prevent them from becoming disconnected. A short wire or positive locking device attaching the air hose to the tool must also be used and will serve as an added safeguard.</p>\r\r<p>If an air hose is more than ½ inch (12.7 millimeters) in diameter, a safety excess flow valve must be installed at the source of the air supply to reduce pressure in case of hose failure. In general, the same precautions should be taken with an air hose that are recommended for electric cords because the hose is subject to the same kind of damage or accidental striking, and because it also presents tripping hazards.</p>\r\r<p>When using pneumatic tools, a safety clip or retainer must be installed to prevent attachments such as chisels on a chipping hammer from being ejected during tool operation.</p>\r\r<p>Pneumatic tools that shoot nails, rivets, staples, or similar fasteners and operate at pressures more than 100 pounds per square inch (6,890 kPa), must be equipped with a special device to keep fasteners from being ejected, unless the muzzle is pressed against the work surface.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:938}}</p>\r\r<p>Airless spray guns that atomize paints and fluids at pressures of 1,000 pounds or more per square inch (6,890 kPa) must be equipped with automatic or visible manual safety devices that will prevent pulling the trigger until the safety device is manually released.</p>\r\r<p>Eye protection is required, and head and face protection is recommended for employees working with pneumatic tools. Screens must also be set up to protect nearby workers from being struck by flying fragments around chippers, riveting guns, staplers, or air drills.</p>\r\r<p>Compressed air guns should never be pointed toward anyone. Workers should never "dead-end" them against themselves or anyone else. A chip guard must be used when compressed air is used for cleaning.</p>\r\r<p>Use of heavy jackhammers can cause fatigue and strains. Heavy rubber grips reduce these effects by providing a secure handhold. Workers operating a jackhammer must wear safety glasses and safety shoes that protect them against injury if the jackhammer slips or falls. A face shield also should be used.</p>\r\r<p>Noise is another hazard associated with pneumatic tools. Working with noisy tools such as jackhammers requires proper, effective use of appropriate hearing protection.</p>', 6, 176, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(694, 'ms0130_07', '<h3>Liquid Fuel Tools</h3><p>Fuel-powered tools are usually operated with gasoline. The most serious hazard associated with the use of fuel-powered tools comes from fuel vapors that can burn or explode and also give off dangerous exhaust fumes. The worker must be careful to handle, transport, and store gas or fuel only in approved flammable liquid containers, according to proper procedures for flammable liquids.</p>\r\r<p>Before refilling a fuel-powered tool tank, the user must shut down the engine and allow it to cool to prevent accidental ignition of hazardous vapors. When a fuel-powered tool is used inside a closed area, effective ventilation and/or proper respirators such as atmosphere-supplying respirators must be utilized to avoid breathing carbon monoxide. Fire extinguishers must also be available in the area.</p>\r\r<h3>Powder-Actuated Tools</h3>\r\r<p>Powder-actuated tools operate like a loaded gun and must be treated with extreme caution. In fact, they are so dangerous that they must be operated only by specially trained employees.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:939}}</p>\r\r<p>When using powder-actuated tools, an employee must wear suitable ear, eye, and face protection. The user must select a powder level—high or low velocity—that is appropriate for the powder-actuated tool and necessary to do the work without excessive force.</p>\r\r<p>The muzzle end of the tool must have a protective shield or guard centered perpendicular to and concentric with the barrel to confine any fragments or particles that are projected when the tool is fired. A tool containing a high-velocity load must be designed not to fire unless it has this kind of safety device.</p>\r\r<p>To prevent the tool from firing accidentally, two separate motions are required for firing. The first motion is to bring the tool into the firing position, and the second motion is to pull the trigger. The tool must not be able to operate until it is pressed against the work surface with a force of at least 5 pounds (2.2 kg) greater than the total weight of the tool.</p>\r\r<p>If a powder-actuated tool misfires, the user must hold the tool in the operating position for at least 30 seconds before trying to fire it again. If it still will not fire, the user must hold the tool in the operating position for another 30 seconds and then carefully remove the load in accordance with the manufacturer\'s instructions. This procedure will make the faulty cartridge less likely to explode. The bad cartridge should then be put in water immediately after removal. If the tool develops a defect during use, it should be tagged and must be taken out of service immediately until it is properly repaired.</p>\r\r<p>Safety precautions that must be followed when using powder-actuated tools include the following:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<ul>\r<li>Do not use a tool in an explosive or flammable atmosphere.\r<li>Inspect the tool before using it to determine that it is clean, that all moving parts operate freely, and that the barrel is free from obstructions and has the proper shield, guard, and attachments recommended by the manufacturer.\r<li>Do not load the tool unless it is to be used immediately.\r<li>Do not leave a loaded tool unattended, especially where it would be available to unauthorized persons.\r<li>Keep hands clear of the barrel end.\r<li>Never point the tool at anyone.\r</ul>\n</div>\n\r<p>When using powder-actuated tools to apply fasteners, several additional procedures must be followed:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\n<ul>\r<li>Do not fire fasteners into material that would allow the fasteners to pass through to the other side.\r<li>Do not drive fasteners into very hard or brittle material that might chip or splatter or make the fasteners ricochet.\r<li>Always use an alignment guide when shooting fasteners into existing holes.\r<li>When using a high-velocity tool, do not drive fasteners more than 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from an unsupported edge or corner of material such as brick or concrete.\r</ul>\n</div>\n\r<p>When using a high velocity tool, do not place fasteners in steel any closer than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from an unsupported corner edge unless a special guard, fixture, or jig is used.</p>', 7, 260, 1, NULL, NULL),

Mediation is a free and entirely voluntary process to help parties resolve their differences and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Parties exchange information and work together with a neutral mediator to try to resolve the complaint. If parties reach a settlement, the ASCHR will dismiss the complaint. If no settlement is reached, the case will be transferred for a full and impartial investigation.</p>\r\r<h3>The Investigation Process</h3>\r\r<p>The ASCHR impartially investigates the complainant\'s allegations. During the investigation the ASCHR does <u>not</u> advocate for one side or the other. The ASCHR first sends a copy of the complaint to the respondent (the person or business against whom discrimination is alleged). The respondent may provide a written response to the ASCHR. The ASCHR will assign an investigator to the case, who will then interview witnesses, collect documents, and may visit the site of the alleged discrimination or gather evidence in other ways. The ASCHR also has the power to subpoena witnesses or documents, if it becomes necessary to do so.</p>\r\r<p>After the investigation is complete, the ASCHR staff will issue a finding called a Determination. The Determination may conclude that:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>the investigation did not find “substantial evidence” that discrimination occurred and the complaint therefore will be dismissed; or \r<li>the investigation found “substantial evidence” exists that discrimination occurred and the complaint will be referred for conciliation (settlement). \r</ol>\n</div>\n\r<h3>The Conciliation Process</h3>\r\r<p>If the ASCHR staff finds “substantial evidence” to believe discrimination occurred, the ASCHR will immediately contact the parties and attempt to facilitate conciliation. The respondent will be asked to cease the discriminatory act or practice. The respondent also may be asked to provide make-whole relief to the complainant, undergo training in the laws prohibiting discrimination, adopt an anti-discrimination policy, or take other actions necessary to remedy the discrimination uncovered during the investigation.</p>\r\r<p>The ASCHR will dismiss the case after the parties have met the requirements set forth in the conciliation agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the ASCHR’s Executive Director will certify conciliation failure and may decide to file a formal Accusation and refer the case for public hearing.</p>\r\r<h3>Confidentiality</h3>\r\r<p>Under the Alaska Human Rights Law, cases are confidential and the ASCHR is prohibited from disclosing the names of parties or any records or information obtained during an investigation. If a case fails conciliation, the case is no longer considered confidential and may be referred for public hearing.</p>\r\r<p>After conciliation failure, the records and information obtained during the investigation become available to the parties. The records of investigation may also be made available according to the rules of discovery if an action relating to the charge is filed in court.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Alaska state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

After a completed questionnaire is received, the complainant will be contacted within approximately 24 hours to schedule an intake interview with the CRD.</p>\r\r<p>After a charge of discrimination is filed, the CRD will begin an investigation of the allegations contained within the charge. An investigation may include conducting interviews, obtaining documents, and doing site visits. Generally, after investigation, the CRD will determine either that no unlawful discriminatory practice or act has occurred or that there is “reasonable cause” to believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice or act has occurred.</p>\r\r<p>If, after an investigation, the CRD determines that no unlawful discriminatory practice or act has occurred, the CRD will notify the parties in writing of this fact. On the other hand if, after an investigation, the CRD determines there is “reasonable cause” to believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice or act has occurred, the CRD may bring a civil action. Whether the CRD investigation concludes that an unlawful discriminatory practice or act has occurred or has not occurred, private parties retain the right to bring their own civil action within the time limitations specified by law.</p>\r\r<p>Arizona law allows individuals to file a civil action pertaining to discriminatory practices as long as it is filed not later than 2 years after the occurrence. A civil court action or proceeding may allow the prevailing party reasonable attorney\'s fees as part of the costs.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Arizona state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

The courts in Arkansas have ruled that the ACRA prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace.

If harassment and/or abusive conduct occurs, {{LOCATION:NAME}} may be liable even if management was not aware of the harassment or abuse. {{LOCATION:NAME}} might avoid liability if the harasser/abuser is a non-management employee, the employer had no knowledge of the harassment and/or abusive conduct, and there was a program to prevent harassment and abusive conduct. If the harasser is a non-management employee, {{LOCATION:NAME}} may avoid liability if they take immediate and appropriate corrective action to stop the harassment and/or abusive conduct once they learn about it. {{LOCATION:NAME}} is strictly liable for harassment and abusive conduct by their supervisors or agents. The harasser/abuser can be held personally liable for damages. Additionally, Government Code section 12940, subdivision (k), requires {{LOCATION:NAME}} to take "all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring." If an employer has failed to take such preventative measures, that employer can be held liable for the harassment and/or abusive conduct.

Thus <i>federal</i> law does <u>not</u> prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not “extremely serious.” Rather, the conduct must be “so objectively offensive as to alter the ‘conditions’ of the victim’s employment.”</p>\r\r<p>Assembly Bill 2053 went into effect on January 1, 2015, requiring California employers <i>with 50 or more</i> employees to include supervisor training on the “prevention of abusive conduct” along with the sexual harassment training already required by law.</p>\r\r<p>The state of California defines abusive conduct as “conduct of an employer or employee in the workplace, with malice, that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to an employer\'s legitimate business interests.”</p>\r\r<p>Examples of abusive conduct include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the use of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets.\r<li>Verbal or physical conduct that a reasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating.\r<li>The gratuitous sabotage or undermining of a person\'s work performance. \r</ul>\n</div>\r\r<p>California law specifically states that “a single act shall <u>not</u> constitute abusive conduct, unless especially severe and egregious.”</p>\r\r<p>In simple terms, what this means is that employees in California cannot be bullied at work. If one examines the protected classes (race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status) there are ways to harass employees that are not protected. California is the first state to close this loophole and provide protection from any harassment purposely aimed to cause harm to an employee that “a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to an employer’s legitimate business interests.”</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>EXAMPLE 1:</h4>\r\r<p>A new employee is not liked by his fellow colleagues. These workers decide that they are going to make his time at work a living Hell. They call him names such as “loser,” “scumbag,” and “druggie” every chance they get.</p>\r\r<h4>EXAMPLE 2:</h4>\r\r<p>A fleet supervisor has a personal beef with one of her drivers. She wants to make him quit, so she repeatedly tells the driver that she has modified his truck and “hopes he makes it back in one piece.”</p>\r\r<h4>EXAMPLE 3:</h4>\r\r<p>There is a group of employees that have been working together for years and they are considered bullies. Every new worker is warned to stay away from them or fear their wrath. When an employee complains to her supervisor that the work these people are doing is unsafe and their manufactured products have defects, she is told that he “will look into it, but it will probably do nothing.” The group finds out about her complaint and verbally threatens her to keep her mouth shut or face the consequences.</p></div>\r\r<p>As you can see, some of these examples are criminal in nature, but aren’t protected under current anti-discrimination laws. Employees have the right to work in a workplace that is not abusive or offensive. A hostile work environment is not longer just related to sexual harassment. Employers and individual employees can be held liable for creating such an environment.</p>\r\r<h2>Enforcement of the Law</h2>\r\r<p>Employees or job applicants who believe that they have been sexually harassed may, <i>within 1 year of the harassment</i>, file a complaint of discrimination with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). The DFEH will investigate the complaint and attempt to resolve the disputes. If the DFEH finds evidence of sexual harassment or abusive conduct and settlement efforts fail, the DFEH may file a formal accusation against the employer and the harasser. The accusation may lead to either a public hearing before the Fair Employment and Housing Commission or a lawsuit filed on the complainant\'s behalf by the DFEH. If the Fair Employment and Housing Commission finds that harassment or abusive conduct occurred, it can order remedies, including up to $150,000 in fines and/or damages for emotional distress from each employer or harasser/abuser charged. In addition, the Fair Employment and Housing Commission may order hiring/reinstatement, back pay, promotion, training, and changes in the policies or practices of the involved employer.</p>\r\r<h3>How to Address Sexual Harassment</h3>\r\r<p>{{LOCATION:NAME}} must take immediate and appropriate action when he/she knows or should have known that sexual harassment or abusive conduct has occurred. {{LOCATION:NAME}} must take effective action to stop any further harassment or abusive conduct and to minimize any effects of the harassment and/or abusive conduct. To those ends, {{LOCATIONS:NAME}} policy should include provisions to:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Fully inform the complainant of his/her rights.\r<li>Fully and effectively investigate. The investigation must be immediate, thorough, objective and complete. Anyone with information on the matter should be interviewed. A determination must be made and the results communicated to the complainant, to the alleged harasser/abuser, and, as appropriate, to all others directly concerned.\r<li>If harassment or abusive conduct is proven, there must be prompt and effective remedial action. First, appropriate action must be taken against the harasser/abuser and communicated to the complainant. Second, steps must be taken to prevent further harassment and/or abusive conduct. Third, appropriate action must be taken to remedy the complainant\'s loss, if any.\r</ul>\n</div>\r\r<h2>Typical Sexual Harassment Cases</h2>\r\r<p>The three most common types of sexual harassment complaints filed with the Department are:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>An employee is fired or denied a job or an employment benefit because he/she refused to grant sexual favors or because he/she complained about harassment. Retaliation for complaining about harassment is illegal, even if it cannot be demonstrated that the harassment actually occurred.\r<li>An employee quits because he/she can no longer tolerate an offensive work environment, referred to as a "constructive discharge" harassment case. If it is proven that a reasonable person, under like conditions, would resign to escape the harassment and/or abusive conduct, the employer may be held responsible for the resignation as if the employee had been discharged.\r<li>An employee is exposed to an offensive work environment. Exposure to various kinds of behavior or to unwanted sexual advances alone may constitute harassment.\r</ol></div>\n\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in California</h2>\r\r<p>The DFEH maintains the authority to investigate complaints of discrimination in the areas of employment, housing, public accommodations, and hate violence.

The CCRD works to eliminate and prevent discrimination in these areas through investigation, education, mediation, and enforcement. The CAA applies to all employers in the state. The Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS), Center for Equal Opportunity and Risk Management (CEORM) investigates complaints of discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:978}}</p>\r\r<p>Employers are encouraged to take all steps necessary to prevent workplace harassment from occurring, such as affirmatively raising the subject, expressing strong disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment, and developing methods to sensitize all concerned.</p>\r\r<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment which results in discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations or advertising is a violation of the Law. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Colorado defines sexual harassment as a violation of the Law when either, submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a requirement of employment, housing, public accommodations or advertising, or an individual’s response to such conduct is the basis for decisions which deny the individual rights protected by the Law.</p>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment shall be determined from the totality of the circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to, the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred.</p>\r	\r<p>Sexual harassment can involve an employee being pressured to submit to unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors in exchange for retaining or gaining certain job opportunities or terms or conditions of employment. Sexual harassment also can involve an employee being confronted with unwelcome sexual conduct that is so pervasive or severe as to interfere with the employee\'s job performance or to create a hostile or offensive working environment.</p>\r\r<p>Hostile work environment applies in cases where the hostile work environment is a result of discrimination or harassment based upon race, national origin, creed, color, sex, age, or religion. Hostile work environment does not apply by itself; it is a byproduct of discrimination or harassment of a protected class.</p>\r\r<h2>Workplace Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>It shall be a discriminatory or unfair employment practice for an employer, its agents, or supervisory employees, to harass, with or without loss of income or other tangible employment action, a person during the course of employment, based upon an individual’s protected class status. Harassment occurs if the discriminatory treatment is severe or pervasive, and has the effect of creating a work environment that is objectively and subjectively hostile, intimidating, or offensive.</p>\r\r<p>With respect to discriminatory harassment in the scope of employment, an employer is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where an employer knows or should have known of the conduct. With respect to discriminatory harassment by a coworker, an employee is required to make a complaint of discriminatory harassment to an individual with supervisory authority and must take advantage of any remedial action offered by an employer. With respect to discriminatory harassment by a person with actual or apparent supervisory authority, an employer is strictly liable for the discriminatory harassment and the employee is <u>not</u> required to complain to the employer.</p>\r\r<p>An employer may also be responsible for the acts of non-employees with respect to workplace harassment of its employees where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate remedial action.</p>\r\r<p>The aforementioned rules also apply to harassment based on retaliation for engaging in a protected activity.</p>\r\r<p>In the event of alleged workplace harassment, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability to a victimized employee. Such defense is that: (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and (2) the victimized employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. This affirmative defense may be established by: a demonstration that the employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy providing for a complaint procedure which was disseminated in the workplace prior to the occurrence of the offensive conduct, and that the employee failed to report the offensive conduct to the appropriate authority in compliance with that complaint procedure. If the alleged harasser is the employer’s ultimate authority, then the affirmative defense may not be raised.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Colorado</h2>\r\r<p>If any charge alleging a violation is to be filed with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, the complaint must be filed <i>within 6 months</i> after the alleged discriminatory or unfair employment practice occurred. If a claim is filed after the 6-month limit, it can only be filed at the federal EEOC level. The EEOC filing must be <i>within 180 days</i> of the alleged incident; the EEOC only has jurisdiction if the employer has <i>15 or more</i> employees.</p>\r\r<p>To file a complaint, the complainant should fill out the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1510}} form and fax it to {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:615}}. An individual may file a claim anonymously, but this makes very difficult to investigate.

A determination on the allegations is made from the facts on a case-by-case basis.</p>\r\r<p>Prevention is the best tool to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace. Employers are encouraged to take steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring. They should clearly communicate to employees that sexual harassment will not be tolerated. They can do so by providing sexual harassment training to their employees and by establishing an effective complaint or grievance process and taking immediate and appropriate action when an employee complains.</p>\r\r<p>It is also unlawful to retaliate against an individual for opposing employment practices that discriminate based on sex or for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under the DDEA.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Delaware</h2>\r\r<p>Any individual (that works for an employer <i>with 4 or more</i> employees) who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated under the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act may file a charge of discrimination with the DDOL. A charge may be filed in person at the DDOL office in Milford or Wilmington. An individual may start the process by downloading and completing the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1520}} and submitting the completed questionnaire to the DDOL Office of Anti-Discrimination. The DDOL will contact the individual to set up an appointment to finalize the filing process.</p>\r\r<p>Individuals who need an accommodation in order to file a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessible format) should inform the DDOL office in advance so appropriate arrangements can be made.</p>\r\r<p>The following information must be provided to file a charge:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>The complaining party\'s name, address, and telephone number;\r<li>The name, address, and telephone number of the respondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known;\r<li>A short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and\r<li>The date(s) of the alleged violation(s).\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>The {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1520}} will help the individual gather the information needed for their specific situation.</p>\r\r<p>All laws enforced by the DDOL require filing a charge with the DDOL <i>before</i> a private lawsuit may be filed in court. There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>A charge must be filed with the DDOL <i>within 120 days</i> from the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party\'s rights to file an action in state court.\r<li>The filing deadline is extended to <i>300 days</i> under federal law when the complaint falls under the criteria of the EEOC. A charge filed between 121 and 300 days will be forwarded to the EEOC for processing, but remember that the EEOC only handles complaints for employers <i>with 15 or more</i> employees.\r<li>To protect legal rights, it is always best to contact the DDOL promptly when discrimination is suspected.\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>Through the use of “worksharing agreements,” the EEOC and the DDOL avoid duplication of effort while at the same time ensuring that a charging party\'s rights are protected under both federal and state law. If a charge is filed with the DDOL, and is also covered by federal law, the DDOL “dual files” the charge with the EEOC to protect federal rights; the charge usually will be retained by the DDOL for handling. If a charge is filed with the EEOC and is also covered by state or local law, the EEOC “dual files” the charge with the state or local Fair Employment Practices Agency (FEPA), but ordinarily retains the charge for handling.</p>\r\r<p>The {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1520}} should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:DOL_AntiDiscrimination@state.de.us">DOL_AntiDiscrimination@state.de.us</a> or via mail to one of the following locations:</p>\r\n\n<table align="center" border="0"> \n<thead> \n<tr> \n<th colspan="2" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:617}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:617}})<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:617}}<br> \nWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:617}} \n</th>		 \n</tr> \n</thead> \n<tbody> \n<tr> \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>New Castle County:</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:617}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:617}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:617}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:617}}<br> \nPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:617}} \n</td> \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>Kent/Sussex Counties:</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:618}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:618}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:618}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:618}}<br> \nPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:618}} \n</td> \n</tr> \n</tbody> \n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once the DDOL reviews the completed form, they will contact the individual to schedule an appointment to complete the process.</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-red">\r<h4>ALERT:</h4> \r\r<p>COMPLETION OF THIS FORM DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FILING A CHARGE.

When analyzing harassment claims brought under state law, the courts in Idaho apply the standards used by federal courts in harassment claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\r\r<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Idaho defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual conduct that is severe enough, or occurs often enough, to interfere with an employee’s ability to do his or her job. Sexual harassment takes many forms, such as touching, sexual comments, or jokes, displays of pornographic materials, indecent exposure, assault, or even rape. Sexual harassment occurs in many different work environments and victimizes both men and women. The harasser may be a person of the opposite sex or the same sex. It is the effect of the sexual conduct, not the harasser’s intent that determines whether the law has been violated. Victims of sexual harassment should not try to ignore it or assume it is a joke or an accident. Sexual harassment is an unlawful use of power. Experience shows that harassment will continue or increase if it is ignored.</p>\r\r<p>Employers may be liable for sexual harassment whether it comes from a supervisor, a coworker, or even from non-employees, such as customers or contractors. Many employers have anti-harassment policies and reporting procedures to deal internally with these problems. Effective policies and employee training can go a long way towards discouraging improper conduct before it becomes serious enough to violate the law.</p>\r\r<p>Retaliation against an individual who has engaged in a protected activity is unlawful. "Protected activity" means opposing conduct which a person, in good faith, reasonably believes to be unlawful under the anti-discrimination statutes or participating in Idaho Commission on Human Rights (IHRC) proceedings, which are set up for the enforcement of the anti-discrimination statutes.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Idaho</h2>\r\r<p>Any person who believes he or she has been subject to unlawful discrimination may file a complaint under oath with the IHRC stating the facts concerning the alleged discrimination <i>within 1 year</i> of the alleged unlawful discrimination.</p>\r\r<p>If an individual feels discrimination is happening, the first thing they should do is contact the IHRC via their <a href="http://humanrights.idaho.gov/contact.html" title="Click Here to Go to Website" target="_blank">online contact page</a> or through the contact info below.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:622}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:622}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:622}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:622}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:622}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:622}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:622}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:622}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:622}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:622}}<br>\rEmail: {{REG_AGENCY_EMAIL:622}}</p>\r\r<p>Initial inquiries are treated confidentially. The individual needs to inform the IHRC about what happened, when, and why they feel they were treated differently. The IHRC may be able to suggest ways that the parties can resolve the situation, they may make an informal contact, or they may decide to file a charge of discrimination.</p>\r\r<p>Idaho law requires that an administrative complaint be filed with the IHRC before a discrimination lawsuit can be filed. An administrative complaint may be drafted by an individual, by a lawyer, or by an IHRC staff member based on information provided by an individual. The laws that protect against retaliation mean only that an action should not be taken against someone because he or she filed a complaint. Employees are still subject to disciplinary actions for other reasons. For instance, if an employee disobeys company rules after filing a charge, an employer can discipline him or her in the same manner as that employer treats others.</p>\r\r<p>Upon receipt of a formal complaint, the IHRC or its delegated investigator shall endeavor to resolve the matter by informal means prior to a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred. The IHRC or its delegated investigator will conduct an investigation as may be necessary to resolve the issues raised by the facts set forth in the complaint.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Idaho state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

The complainant is responsible for notifying the IDHR of any changes.\r<li>Provide accurate and complete information of the employer, (refer to the IRS W-2 form for the correct legal name of the employer), union, other organization or person that is believed to have performed the unlawful discrimination. Include name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s).\r<li>Provide the most recent date the alleged discrimination took place.\r<li>Provide names and contact information for any witnesses and copies of any relevant documents.\r<li>If the allegations are covered under the Illinois Human Rights Act, a charge will be drafted for signature.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h3>Mediation</h3>\r\r<p>A mediation conference is an alternative to an investigation and may quickly resolve a charge. Mediation is an informal, no-cost process in which the complainant and respondent meet voluntarily with a trained and certified IDHR mediator, who helps them explore possible resolution of the charge. The mediation process is confidential.</p>\r\r<p>All mediation settlement conferences are held in the IDHR Chicago office. During the mediation (which can take four hours or more), attorneys may be present in an advisory role. The IDHR mediator does <u>not</u> impose a decision on the parties.</p>\r\r<p>Accepting a settlement agreement does <u>not</u> constitute an admission of guilt by the respondent. The terms of settlement can include monetary and/or non-monetary elements. After a mediation settlement is reached, both parties have 10 days (which may be waived) to opt out of the settlement. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the charge will proceed through to the investigation stage.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>The case moves to the investigation stage if the parties do not participate in mediation or if the mediation is unsuccessful. Complainants and respondents have a responsibility to cooperate with the IDHR\'s investigation. The IDHR also has the power to subpoena relevant documents and persons. The IDHR\'s role is to conduct a neutral investigation of the allegations in the charge. The investigator assigned to the case may contact and interview relevant witnesses and may obtain pertinent documents from both parties. Respondents are required to preserve any records pertinent to the charge. In addition, respondents are prohibited from retaliating against any person because he/she has filed or has otherwise participated in the investigation of a charge. A person who believes he/she has been retaliated against may file a retaliation charge with the IDHR.</p>\r\r<h3>Findings and Results</h3>\r\r<p>After the investigation, a written report is prepared recommending whether or not there is “substantial evidence” of a violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act. A finding of “substantial evidence” means that there is enough evidence for the complainant to take the case either before an administrative law judge at the Illinois Human Rights Commission or an appropriate state circuit court. The IDHR or circuit court will hear testimony, receive evidence, and determine whether unlawful discrimination occurred.</p>\r\r<h3>Legal Review</h3>\r\r<p>Complainants have the right to file a request for review <i>within 30 days</i> of service of the dismissal with the Human Rights Commission. The respondent may file a request for review with the Human Rights Commission <i>within 30 days</i> of service of a notice of default recommendation.</p>\r\r<p>If substantial evidence of discrimination is found, the IDHR provides the parties the opportunity to reach a settlement through conciliation. If conciliation fails, the IDHR files a complaint with the Human Rights Commission and the case is scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge. Both parties will need to obtain legal representation to properly present or defend the case before the administrative law judge.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF ILLINOIS-->\n\n{% elseif state == "IN" %}\n\n<!--START OF INDIANA-->\n\n<h1>Indiana-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The people of Indiana are entitled by law (the Indiana Civil Rights Law) to work and seek employment without being discriminated against on the basis of their disability (physical or mental), national origin, ancestry, race, color, religion, gender, and their status as a veteran.

The mission of the ICRC is to end discrimination within the state of Iowa. To achieve this goal, the ICRC must effectively enforce the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA). The ICRC\'s primary duty is to enforce state and federal laws that prohibit discrimination in employment, public accommodations, housing, education, and credit by investigating and litigating civil rights complaints. The ICRC also provides conflict resolution services including mediation and conciliation for civil rights matters. In addition to its role as a law enforcement agency, the ICRC works to prevent discrimination by providing training and education to the public.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:985}}</p>\r\r<p>The ICRA prohibits employers of <i>4 or more</i> persons (individuals who are members of the employer\'s family shall not be counted as employees) from discriminating in employment on the basis of sex, pregnancy (including conditions related to pregnancy), gender identity, and sexual orientation. Harassment based on a protected characteristic, including sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, or gender identity, is prohibited under state law.</p>\r\r<p>It is also illegal to intentionally aid, abet, compel, or coerce another person to engage in any of the practices declared unfair or discriminatory. In addition, it is illegal to discriminate or retaliate against another person in any of the rights protected against discrimination because such person has lawfully opposed any illegal practice, obeys the provisions of the ICRA, or has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under the ICRA.</p>\r\r<p>The ICRC receives, investigates, mediates, and finally determines the merits of complaints alleging unfair or discriminatory practices. The ICRC investigates and studies the existence, character, causes, and extent of discrimination in public accommodations, employment, apprenticeship programs, on-the-job training programs, vocational schools, credit practices, and housing in the state of Iowa and attempts to eliminate such discrimination by education and conciliation.</p>\r\r<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Iowa defines sexual harassment as persistent, repetitive, or highly egregious conduct directed at a specific individual or group of individuals that a reasonable person would interpret as intentional harassment of a sexual nature, taking into consideration the full context in which the conduct occurs, which conduct threatens to impair the ability of a person to perform the duties of employment, or otherwise function normally within an institution responsible for the person\'s care, rehabilitation, education, or training.</p>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Unsolicited sexual advances by a person toward another person who has clearly communicated the other person\'s desire not to be the subject of those advances.\r<li>Sexual advances or propositions made by a person having superior authority toward another person within the workplace or institution.\r<li>Instances of offensive sexual remarks or speech or graphic sexual displays directed at a person in the workplace or institution, who has clearly communicated the person\'s objection to that conduct, and where the person is not free to avoid that conduct due to the requirements of the employment or the confines or operations of the institution.\r<li>Dress requirements that bear no relation to the person\'s employment responsibilities or institutional status.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Iowa</h2>\r\r<p>Any person who believes that they have been discriminated against in violation of the ICRA may file with the ICRC. The complaint must be filed <i>within 300 days</i> of the alleged discriminatory practice. Filing is the first step in the complaint process. The complaint will also be filed with the EEOC if federal laws apply to the specific case; the EEOC has a time limit of 300 days from the date of the discriminatory incident.</p>\r\r<p>The ICRC is a neutral, objective law enforcement agency. Assistance is available to either party upon request. Either party can contact the ICRC for help in obtaining forms, filling out complaint forms, or who have questions about questionnaires.</p>\r\r<p>To file a complaint, there are three forms that must be filled out and returned to the ICRC:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>{{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1535}} form, which provides basic contact information for the case. \r<li>{{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1536}}, which authorizes the release of the complainant’s personal information to the ICRC during their investigation.\r<li>{{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1537}}, which is the official complaint used to report an incidence of discrimination.

If the complaint is timely and alleges acts covered by the ICRA, a copy of the complaint is mailed to the complainant and respondent(s). The complaint is also assigned a CP# and if applicable, an EEOC#.\r<li>In addition to copies of the complaint, both complainant and respondent are sent questionnaires regarding the complaint and any relevant background information relevant to the complaint. The questionnaires are tailored to the specific basis and type of discriminatory act alleged. \r<li>Respondents may answer the questionnaire or submit a position statement. Both parties are encouraged to provide any relevant documents, video, or audio recordings. The parties are each given 30 days to complete the questionnaire. \r<li>After the ICRC receives all parties’ responses to the questionnaires or the 30 days has passed, the collected information is reviewed by a screener. The complaint will be screened in when the collected information indicates a reasonable possibility of a probable cause determination. \r<li>If the Administrative Law Judge finds no probable cause, the complaint is closed and the complainant loses his/her right to request a “right-to-sue” letter. The complainant can request reconsideration and if the request is denied, the complainant can appeal the finding to District Court.\r<li>If the Administrative Law Judge finds probable cause, the complaint will move to conciliation. A conciliator is assigned to the case and assists the parties in trying to reach a settlement. At this point, the ICRC will advocate on behalf of the complainant as well as seek remedies designed to address the discriminatory practice through such things as policy changes or training and education. \r<li>If conciliation fails, the complaint will be reviewed to determine whether it should proceed to public hearing. If the complaint is selected for public hearing, another Administrative Law Judge from the Department of Inspection and Appeals will preside over the case. A representative will represent the ICRC and the complainant (who may also have private counsel at his/her expense). A hearing will be held in accordance with the “Iowa Administrative Procedure Act” and evidence will be presented from both parties. The standard of proof in an administrative hearing is <i>preponderance of the evidence, meaning more likely than not</i>. The Administrative Law Judge will determine whether or not discrimination occurred based on a preponderance of the evidence presented. If the complaint is not selected for public hearing, the complaint will be administratively closed and the complainant may request a “right-to-sue” letter within 2 years of the administrative closure.\r</ol></div>\n\n<!--END OF IOWA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "KS" %}\n\n<!--START OF KANSAS-->\n\n<h1>Kansas-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Kansas Act Against Discrimination (KAAD) assures equal opportunities and encouragement to every citizen regardless of race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry, in securing and holding, without discrimination, employment in any field of work or labor for which a person is properly qualified.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:989}}</p>\r\r<p>The Kansas Human Rights Commission (KHRC) has the power to eliminate and prevent segregation and discrimination, or separation in employment, in all places of public accommodations covered by the KAAD, in housing because of race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry and in housing because of familial status, either by employers, labor organizations, or employment agencies.</p>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment is generally considered discrimination based on sex.

Mediation services offer a possible alternative to a complete investigation. When both parties do not select mediation services, or when mediation services fail, a complaint may be sent for investigation.</p>\r\r<p>During an investigation, a field investigator will interview the complainant, review relevant documents, conduct interviews with witnesses, and summarize the case for the investigating commissioner. An interview may consist of a written questionnaire. The investigator\'s role is that of a fact finder. The investigator does <u>not</u> determine the outcome of the case, but rather gathers and presents the facts to a commissioner for determination. All information discovered throughout the course of the investigation is confidential and is gathered in an objective and impartial manner.</p>\r\r<p>Depending upon the information obtained during the investigative process, the investigating commissioner makes a determination of either "Probable Cause" or "No Probable Cause". If the KHRC finds "Probable Cause,” then an attempt will be made to reach a written settlement between complainant and respondent. The KHRC is responsible for conciliation of cases where the investigation has indicated there is probable cause to credit allegations of the complaints. If conciliation efforts fail, the case may be scheduled for a public hearing.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Kansas state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

If the individual does not want to participate in mediation, the KCHR will neutrally investigate the complaint, and work to conciliate or settle the complaint.</p>\r \r<p>If a conciliation or settlement is not reached, the Board of Commissioners of the KCHR may act with the authority of a court of law to rule on the complaint. The Commission Board may dismiss the complaint with findings of no probable cause to believe discrimination occurred, or the Commissioners may find the respondent in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.</p>\r\r<p>Once the respondent has received his or her service letter of the complaint, state law (KRS 344.210) gives the respondent 20 days to file an answer to the allegations in that complaint.</p>\r\r<p>Kansas law requires that each complaint be set for a hearing within 60 days after the complaint was filed. Therefore, within the next 60 days, both parties will receive a Notice of Hearing by certified mail setting a date for a hearing. A hearing will only be held after the investigation is complete and a Probable Cause letter is issued.</p>\r\r<p>Upon receiving the respondent’s initial response to the allegations set forward in the complaint, the investigator will then commence analyzing the information submitted and will contact the complainant to review that information with him or her. This is the complainant’s opportunity to tell his or her side of the story. The complainant should be prepared at this time to discuss with the investigator any evidence he or she has to support the allegations and to provide the names (as well as the telephone numbers and addresses if known) of any witnesses the complainant feels have relevant information.</p>\r \r<p>If necessary, the investigator will come to the respondent’s place of business to observe the facility, interview employees, etc. The investigator will conduct what is called an “on-site” visit in a manner that will be least disruptive to the respondent’s business.</p>\r \r<p>The investigator will contact both parties periodically to gather additional information or to update them on the status of the investigation. The parties can contact the investigator any time they have questions or additional information, but they should be aware that due to the amount of time it takes to investigate a complaint and the demands of the other cases in the investigator’s caseload, periods of time may go by where there is no new information to discuss.</p>\r \r<p>At any time during the course of the investigation, the investigator may encourage both the complainant and respondent to entertain the notion of conciliating the case to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. Conciliation is similar to a settlement out of court. Conciliation may take the form of affirmative remedies, such as reinstating the complainant in a job, a change in the respondent’s policies and practices, etc. Conciliation may also take a monetary form, based upon the actual losses the complainant incurred due to the issues involved in the alleged illegal action, including compensation for any embarrassment or humiliation suffered. Conciliation is never forced; it is an alternative method to resolving the issues at hand.</p>\r \r<p>If conciliation is unsuccessful, the investigation will continue until sufficient factual information has been gathered for the investigator to make a recommendation to the KCHR’s Board of Commissioners.</p>\r \r<p>If, at the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator has found that sufficient evidence exists to believe illegal discrimination probably occurred, the investigator will make that recommendation to the KCHR’s Legal Unit. A KCHR Staff Attorney will conduct a legal analysis of the investigator’s findings in light of the current law. If the legal staff agrees with the investigator’s recommendation and issues a Probable Cause letter, and the parties are not able to agree to conciliation, the matter will go to an administrative hearing, which is similar to a civil trial. A KCHR staff attorney will represent the complainant at that hearing.</p>\r \r<p>If, on the other hand, the investigator determines that there is insufficient evidence to support the complainant’s allegations, he or she will make a recommendation of No Probable Cause. The No Probable Cause recommendation will be presented at the monthly meeting of the KCHR. The Board of Commissioners can either accept the No Probable Cause recommendation and dismiss the complaint or return the complaint to the Enforcement Staff for further investigation.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Kentucky state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

The Louisiana Employment Discrimination Law applies to all public employers and private employers with 20 or more employees.

A discrimination claim can be filed either with the LCHR or the EEOC. The two agencies have what is called a “worksharing agreement,” which means that the agencies cooperate with each other to process claims. Filing a claim with both agencies is unnecessary, as long as the complainant indicates to one of the agencies that they want the claim “cross-filed.” To file an official complaint with the LCHR, a claim may be filed by telephone, mail, or in person at the LCHR office located at:</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:636}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:636}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:636}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:636}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:636}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:636}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:636}}<br>\rTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:636}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:636}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:636}}</p>\r\r<p>To file a claim with the EEOC, contact the local EEOC office below:</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:637}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:637}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:637}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:637}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:637}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:637}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:637}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:637}}<br>\rTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:637}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:637}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:637}}</p>\r\r<h3>The Intake Process</h3>\r\r<p>Intake includes an initial screening to determine whether complainants meet guidelines related to the prescribed number of employees and jurisdiction. Complainants whose allegations meet all guidelines: (1) required number of employees and (2) within the 180-day LCHR jurisdictional limit—are sent a letter requesting specifics about the allegations. Only when the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1545}}/{{COURSE_RESOURCE_LANG_FORM:1546}} is returned within the specified time is an investigation acceptance letter mailed to the complainant and the case forwarded to the investigative unit.</p>\r\r<h3>The Investigative and Determination Processes</h3>\r\r<p>The investigator reviews the intake documents and responses to the initial request to determine eligibility for acceptance based on the LCHR jurisdictional area of employment. If, after this review, the investigator determines that the claim is ineligible, a Dismissal and Notice of Rights form is sent to the complainant. Based upon a review of the file, the investigator makes a determination of the charge according to the gravity of the complaint. These may fall into one of three categories:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li><b>Category A:</b> <i>Enforcement Plan/Potential Cause Complaints</i> include (1) complaints that fall within the LCHR enforcement plan and (2) other complaints where further investigation will probably result in a cause finding. Cases are also classified as Category A if irreparable harm will result unless processing is expedited.\r<li><b>Category B:</b> <i>Complaints Requiring Additional Information</i> are complaints that initially appear to have some merit, but will require additional evidence to determine whether continued investigation is likely to result in a cause finding.\r<li><b>Category C:</b> <i>Complaints Suitable for Dismissal</i> may be dismissed when the LCHR has sufficient information from which to conclude that it is not likely that further investigation will result in a cause finding. Category C complaints are usually established and dispensed within the intake unit.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h3>Mediation Offered</h3>\r\r<p>If an apparent determination is made indicating that the alleged discriminatory act has occurred, then mediation is offered to the complainant and respondent. Mediation can expedite the case through a mutually agreed settlement and therefore benefit both parties. If mediation is desired, one of the LCHR’s two certified mediators may proceed with the case. If mediation is successful, the LCHR closes the case.</p>\r\r<h3>Fact Finding</h3>\r\r<p>If mediation is not an option, the investigator will proceed with additional fact-finding, including site visits, interviews, and requests for additional documentation of allegations. The complainant has 10 days to submit any additional information requested. The investigator then submits a formal Notice of Charge to the respondent and a Request for Information. The respondent has 30 days to respond to the Request for Information.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination Is Established</h3>\r\r<p>Once a determination is established, the LCHR submits a copy of the determination to the complainant, the respondent, and to the EEOC in cases of employment discrimination.</p>\r\r<h3>Resolution Determinations</h3>\r\r<p>After determination has been reached, the LCHR undertakes several procedural factors to close cases. The “no cause” and “merit factor resolution” determination discussions explain the procedural process.</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li><b>No Cause:</b> In general, a “no cause” finding arises when the file contains insufficient evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that a statute has been violated. When a no cause resolution is determined, the complainant may appeal to the EEOC in cases of employment discrimination, in which a substantial weight review will be done, or an appeal may be made to the LCHR. Decisions rendered by the LCHR Commissioners and the EEOC are final.\r<li><b>Merit Factor Resolutions:</b> In case of a finding for the complainant, the LCHR would proceed to employ remedies that provide “make whole” relief to the complainant based on the merits of the charge. When a merit factor resolution is determined in favor of the complainant, the respondent may appeal to the EEOC only in employment discrimination cases, in which a substantial weight review will be done, or an appeal may be made to the LCHR Commissioners.\r</ul></div>\r\n\n<!--END OF LOUISIANA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "ME" %}\n\n<!--START OF MAINE-->\n\n<h1>Maine-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC) has the duty of investigating all conditions and practices within the state of Maine that allegedly detract from the enjoyment, by each inhabitant of the State, of full human rights and personal dignity.

Because Massachusetts’ courts have determined that the Legislature intended that an employer be liable for discrimination committed by those on whom it confers authority, the courts have adopted the theory of <i>vicarious liability</i> in harassment cases. An employer is liable for the actions of its managers and supervisors because they are conferred with substantial authority over subordinates and are thus considered agents of the employer. In some circumstances, an employer may be liable for the actions of a supervisor, even if that supervisor does <u>not</u> have direct supervisory authority over the complainant.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Massachusetts</h2>\r\r<p>A charge of discrimination should be filed at an MCAD office.

Upon arriving at the MCAD, the complainant is interviewed by an Intake staff person. This is a private consultation.</p>\r\r<h3>The Intake Office</h3>\r\r<p>Once an initial determination has been made that the MCAD has jurisdiction over a particular case, the complainant meets with an investigator to “tell their story.” The investigator uses the facts gathered from this discussion to draft a formal, written complaint. A copy of the complaint is sent to the person or organization, known as the “Respondent,” against whom the complaint has been filed.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>The MCAD first obtains a statement from the respondent that outlines their position regarding the complaint. Shortly thereafter, a meeting is usually held at the MCAD that brings together the complainant and the respondent. The purpose of the meeting is to gather information surrounding the complaint and to discuss the possibility of a voluntary resolution of the complaint. If a resolution is not reached, the investigator will continue to gather information by interviewing witnesses, obtaining documents, making visits to the place of employment, or other appropriate on-site visits.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination</h3>\r\r<p>At the conclusion of an investigation, the Investigating Commissioner will make a formal determination of either “Probable Cause” or “Lack of Probable Cause.”</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li><b>Probable Cause:</b> means that the MCAD has found sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that unlawful discrimination may have occurred. The case then proceeds to the next step in the process. If Probable Cause is found, efforts at resolution between the complainant and the respondent are attempted. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the case goes to Public Hearing.\r<li><b>Lack of Probable Cause:</b> means that the MCAD did not find sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that unlawful discrimination occurred. A complainant has a right to appeal a determination of Lack of Probable Cause within 10 days of receiving the decision. The Investigating Commissioner holds an informal hearing and the complainant has an opportunity to explain why he/she believes the determination was wrong. The Commissioner may uphold the determination, send the case back for further investigation, or reverse the finding. If the determination of Lack of Probable Cause is sustained, the case is closed and goes no further at the MCAD.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h3>Public Hearings</h3>\r\r<p>A Public Hearing is a formal proceeding at which witnesses testify under oath before one of the three MCAD Commissioners. The Commissioner serves as the judge and reviews testimony and documents submitted at the Hearing. Complainants and respondents can hire an attorney to represent them at the hearing. When the complainant does not have an attorney, an MCAD lawyer will prosecute a case on behalf of the Commission.</p>\r\r<h3>Decisions</h3>\r\r<p>The Commissioner reviews legal briefs submitted at the end of the Public Hearing and issues a decision either in favor of the complainant or the respondent. If the MCAD finds in favor of the respondent, the case is dismissed. If the decision is in favor of the complainant, the MCAD may order any one of a number of remedies. In employment cases, this may include awards of back pay and emotional distress damages. In both employment and housing cases, the MCAD has the authority to assess reasonable attorney fees and costs.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Massachusetts state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

If a basis is determined, the department will write a formal, written charge and mail it to the complainant. If the department decides that there is no basis, the reasons will be explained to the complainant. The complainant must sign the charge before a notary public, who will witness their signature. Then it must be returned signed and notarized <i>within 1 year</i> of when the discrimination occurred. After the return of the signed charge, the department will determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the claims of illegal discrimination.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>When the MDHR receives a signed charge, the department will collect information necessary to determine if the allegations of discrimination warrant a formal investigation. This does <u>not</u> mean that the department has decided there has been a violation of the law. It simply means that the complaint falls under the MDHR’s jurisdiction and has authority to investigate. At this stage, the department takes no position and looks at evidence from both sides.</p>\r\r<p>A charge may be filed at the federal EEOC level if it meets the criteria for filing under federal employment discrimination laws enforced by that agency. Under the MDHR’s workshare agreement with the EEOC, and if the charge is eligible, the MDHR will automatically cross-file the complaint with the EEOC. To do this, the complaint must be within the statute of limitations for the applicable federal law. Federal laws have a shorter period for filing a complaint.</p>\r\r<p>If the discrimination happened in Saint Paul or in Minneapolis, the complaint may be filed with the St. Paul Human Rights Department or the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights instead of filing with this department.</p>\r\r<p>After the department has investigated the complaint, the commissioner of Human Rights will decide, based on the evidence, whether discrimination probably occurred ("probable cause") or not ("no probable cause").</p>\r\r<h3>Decision</h3>\r\r<p>If the commissioner decides there is good reason to believe discrimination occurred, the department will refer the case to the Minnesota State Attorney General\'s Office for further action. The commissioner may not find evidence of discrimination. If the commissioner decides there is no good reason to believe discrimination occurred, the department will close the case.</p>\r\r<h2>Mediation</h2>\r\r<p>The MDHR’s mediation program is a voluntary alternative dispute resolution process by which the parties attempt to settle their dispute with the help of a trained mediator.</p>\r\r<p>There is no direct cost to either party for the mediation service. If mediation is successful in resolving the discrimination issue, the case will be closed without an investigation and the department will take no further action. If the parties are not able to reach an agreement in mediation, the department will proceed with the investigation process and decide if there is probable cause to believe discrimination occurred.</p>\r\r<p>Mediation is a confidential dispute resolution process in which a trained neutral mediator assists the charging party and respondent to resolve claims of discrimination without assigning fault or blame to either party. All information shared during a mediation session is regarded as confidential and cannot be revealed to anyone outside the mediation session, including the MDHR.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF MINNESOTA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "MS" %}\n\n<!--START OF MISSISSIPPI-->\n\n<h1>Mississippi-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The state of Mississippi does not have any specific laws/regulations that pertain to sexual harassment by private employers, which means that employees within Mississippi fall under the federal jurisdiction of the EEOC.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:998}}</p>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment lawsuits are stressful and expensive.

The investigator interviews witnesses, gathers and reviews documents, and writes an investigative summary.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination</h3>\r\r<p>If a case is not settled, the MCHR Chairperson will set the matter for hearing or dismiss the case. A determination of “No Probable Cause” means no discrimination was found and the MCHR closes its case and notifies the complainant of his/her Right to Sue. The complainant then has 90 days to file suit against the respondent.</p>\r\r<h3>The Hearing Process</h3>\r\r<p>At the hearing, the MCHR’s case is generally presented by an Assistant Attorney General. The Hearing Examiner conducts the hearing and issues a finding and recommendation.</p>\r\r<h3>Final Decision and Order</h3>\r\r<p>The MCHR issues a Final Decision and Order. If no discrimination is found, then the case is dismissed. If discrimination is found, remedies are ordered. Remedies may include re-instatement or promotion, back pay, and damages for pain, suffering, humiliation, and deprivation of rights. Either party has the right to appeal the decision to circuit court.</p>\r\r<p>An individual may contact the MCHR at any time.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:683}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:683}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:683}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:683}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:683}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:683}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:683}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:683}}<br>\rTDD: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:683}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:683}}<br>\rEmail: {{REG_AGENCY_EMAIL:683}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:683}}</p>\r\r<h3>Notice of Right to Sue</h3>\r\r<p>A Notice of Right to Sue from the MCHR allows an individual to file a suit in state court on the discriminatory acts alleged in the complaint that was filed with the MCHR.

The MHRA applies to all employers in the state <i>regardless of size</i>. It is also unlawful to retaliate against an individual because the individual has opposed any practices forbidden under the MHRA or because the individual has filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation or proceeding under the MHRA.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:999}}</p>\n\n<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Employees have a right to work in an environment free of sexual harassment. Montana defines sexual harassment as unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>submission to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment;\r<li>submission to, or rejection of, the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision;\r<li>the conduct has the effect of unreasonably interfering with work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment also includes:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>harassment directed toward a person because of gender;\r<li>a pattern of favoritism toward sexual partners.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h3>Examples of Sexual Harassment</h3>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment is determined on a case-by-case basis. Acts that are offensive to one employee may not be offensive to another. However, in addition to sexual assault, the following acts may constitute sexual harassment:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>propositions or pressure to engage in sexual activity;\r<li>repeated body contact;\r<li>repeated sexual jokes, innuendoes, or comments;\r<li>constant leering or staring;\r<li>inappropriate comments concerning appearance;\r<li>hiring or promoting a sex partner over more qualified persons;\r</ul></div>\r\r<h2>Employer Liability</h2>\r\r<p>Employers may be liable for monetary compensation and other forms of relief to employees who are victims of sexual harassment by:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>the owner or manager;\r<li>supervisors, whether or not the employer knew of the sexual harassment;\r<li>coworkers, when the employer knew or should have known of the sexual harassment and failed to take immediate corrective action;\r<li>non-employees in the workplace when the employer knew, or should have known of the sexual harassment and failed to take immediate corrective action.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Montana</h2>\r\r<p>The Montana Human Rights Bureau is charged with enforcing certain state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination. When a person files a complaint with the MHRB, the Bureau will informally investigate.</p>\r\r<p>If an individual thinks they have been discriminated against, they should contact the MHRB for an intake appointment. It is important to know that a person only has <i>180 days</i> from when an adverse act happened (or when it was discovered) to have a written complaint filed with the MHRB. This time may be extended, but only in limited circumstances.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:684}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:684}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:684}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:684}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:684}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:684}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:684}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:684}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:684}}</p>\r\r<h3>Intake</h3>\r\r<p>If the alleged discrimination is within the jurisdiction of the MHRB, a telephone interview will be scheduled with an investigator. If the facts indicate that illegal discrimination may have occurred, an investigator will take the information by telephone and draft a formal complaint, for signature by the complainant. A formal complaint must be filed with the MHRB <i>within 180 days</i> of the alleged discriminatory action.</p>\r\r<p>The MHRB is a neutral administrative agency in the process. The person filing the complaint is referred to as the "charging party." The business or entity against whom the complaint is filed is called the "respondent."</p>\r\r<p>Once a complaint is filed with the MHRB, the respondent will be notified within 10 days. The complaint may also be dual filed with the EEOC if the allegations fall under federal employment discrimination laws.</p>\r\r<h3>Voluntary Resolution</h3>\r\r<p>Voluntary resolution can expedite a discrimination case. It\'s a faster alternative and the parties retain control. If an individual is considering voluntary resolution or would like more information, they need to discuss this with the investigator. If the parties wish to discuss voluntary resolution, the MHRB has the option of adding up to 45 days to conduct its informal investigation.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>The case is assigned to an investigator who will conduct an informal investigation to determine if illegal discrimination occurred. The investigator will obtain a position statement from the respondent. The position statement will be forwarded to the charging party for a rebuttal.</p>\r\r<p>The investigator may request additional information, make an on-site inspection, or hold an in person fact-finding conference, as part of the informal investigation.</p>\r\r<p>The fact-finding conference is an informal meeting that provides each party the opportunity to present their position in the case. The investigator will also work with the parties to reach a voluntary no-fault resolution of the case.</p>\r\r<p>The investigation must be completed <i>within 180 days</i>. If the case cannot be resolved, a Final Investigative Report summarizing the investigation is issued to the parties. In this report, the investigator recommends a finding of “reasonable cause,” meaning there is reason to believe that illegal discrimination occurred; or “no reasonable cause,” meaning the evidence does not support a finding that illegal discrimination occurred.</p>\r\r<h3>Conciliation</h3>\r\r<p>If a “reasonable cause” finding is issued, the MHRB staff attempts to conciliate the case with the parties. Conciliation may include compensation for any losses incurred, making employment available to the charging party, modifying any practices having an adverse effect on protected classes, and taking other affirmative steps needed to eliminate discrimination.</p>\r\r<h3>Public Hearing</h3>\r\r<p>When conciliation is not possible, the Department of Labor and Industry will hold a public hearing. A hearing examiner will conduct a formal hearing subject to the rules of evidence and procedure, similar to a non-jury trial in district court. The hearing examiner will issue a Final Agency Decision regarding whether discrimination occurred. If appropriate, the hearing officer will award monetary damages, and other affirmative relief. This decision can be appealed to the Montana Human Rights Commission.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF MONTANA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "NE" %}\n\n<!--START OF NEBRASKA-->\n\n<h1>Nebraska-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission (NEOC) is authorized to enforce the Nebraska Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), disability, or marital status.

From the date of alleged harm, the time limit for filing charges is <i>300 days</i>.</p>\r\r<h3>Intake</h3>\r\r<p>People contacting the NEOC to file a charge of discrimination will be referred to the agency\'s intake unit to set up an appointment. These staff members are trained to assist potential complainants in discerning whether particular alleged harms would be covered under the laws that the NEOC enforces. During the interview, the intake investigator will explain the relevant laws that the NEOC enforces and talk with the complainant about the law\'s relation to the alleged harm. The intake interviewer will help the complainant identify the basis of harm. Additionally, the intake staff will help explain various jurisdictional issues. If the complainant chooses to file a charge, the intake investigator will prepare a formal charge of discrimination that the complainant must sign and have notarized.</p>\r\r<h3>Service</h3>\r\r<p>Service is the next step in the complaint process. Once the charge is filed (signed by the complainant and notarized), the NEOC must serve the charge on the respondent within 10 days. Employment respondents have 30 days from the day they receive the charge of discrimination to prepare their response and produce the documents requested at the time of service.</p>\r\r<p>At this time, both the complainant and the respondent will be offered an opportunity to participate in a pre-determination settlement process (PDS) or in mediation. If both parties agree, the case will be immediately given to someone who will facilitate settlement discussions. If either or both parties decline participation in the PDS or mediation process or if an attempted settlement fails, the employment case file will be placed in the NEOC\'s case repository to await assignment for investigation.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>Investigation is the next step in the complaint process. The NEOC determines the appropriate level of investigation in each case. Both parties to the complaint will be notified in writing when the case is assigned to an investigator. The investigator will request information and documentation from both parties. Complainant and respondent witnesses may be interviewed. The investigator will share with both parties the information given by the other, for the purpose of clarification/verification. Each party will be given a chance to respond to the information provided by the other party and to give the investigator evidence to support their position.</p>\r\r<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\r<p>Conclusion of the investigation is important. The investigator will review the allegations and the evidence gathered with the complainant. The investigator will also inform the respondent of the completion of the investigation and offer them an opportunity to furnish additional relevant evidence. The purpose of the final meeting, called a "pre-determination interview," is to ensure that each party is given a chance to understand what has transpired, what has been found, and what, if anything, either party believes should be looked into further.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination</h3>\r\r<p>Determination is the final stage. The decision is made by the Executive Director in cases of employment discrimination other than age or equal pay complaints. It is important to know that the investigator does not make the actual decision on the case. Only the Executive Director can render such a decision. Both parties will receive a Formal Determination letter from the NEOC that explains the decision that has been rendered and what subsequent actions, if any, will be or should be taken.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Nebraska state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

There are generally two types of sexual harassment. <i>Quid pro quo</i> harassment occurs when an employer, or an employer\'s agent, implicitly or explicitly attempts to make submission to sexual demands a condition of employment. Thus, an employee may perceive that he or she must tolerate sexual advances or engage in a sexual relationship in order to continue employment, to achieve advancement, or to avoid adverse employment consequences such as poor evaluations or demotions. Similarly, it is unlawful for an employer or an employer\'s agent to condition favorable treatment such as promotions, salary increases, or preferred assignments, on an employee\'s acceptance of sexual advances or relations.</p>\r \r<p><i>Hostile work environment</i> sexual harassment occurs when an employee is subjected to sexual, abusive, or offensive conduct because of his or her gender. Such conduct creates an unlawful work environment when it is severe or pervasive enough to make a reasonable person of the employee\'s gender believe that the conditions of employment have been altered and the working environment has become hostile or abusive. The conduct does <u>not</u> have to be sexual in nature and does <u>not</u> have to involve physical contact.

This process is called “intake.” If their claims are within the 180-day time period and implicate the LAD, then the complaint will be accepted. A DCR employee will assist in the preparation of a formal complaint. Once the individual files a verified complaint, they are known as the Complainant. The verified complaint will be sent to the other side (known as the Respondent) and the DCR will demand an answer and response from the respondent.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation & Findings</h3>\r\r<p>Once a complaint is accepted and a response from the respondent is provided, the DCR will conduct an investigation. This process is referred to as the “investigation” phase. The DCR will assign it to an investigator who may be a different investigator than the person involved during the intake process. This investigator will typically request additional documents and information from the parties and interview witnesses and other people who may have relevant information. This investigator examines the allegations and responses in a thorough, objective, and timely manner. At the end of the investigation, the investigator reports his or her findings to the DCR Director and makes a recommendation. There are three possible outcomes of an investigation: 1) a finding of probable cause; 2) a finding of no probable cause; and 3) an agency determination:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol>\r<li>A “Finding of Probable Cause” is issued when an investigation reasonably concludes that probable cause exists to credit the allegations of the verified complaint.\r<li>A “Finding of No Probable Cause” is issued when an investigation reasonably concludes that no probable cause exists to credit the allegations of the verified complaint. If a finding of no probable cause is issued, the case is closed without further proceedings by the DCR. However, a finding of no probable cause is an appealable decision before the New Jersey Appellate Division.\r<li>An “Agency Determination” is issued when an investigation reasonably concludes that probable cause exists to credit some allegations of the verified complaint but that no probable cause exists with respect to other allegations contained in the verified complaint. Agency Determinations are considered findings of probable cause with respect to the credited allegations.\r</ol></div>\r\r<p>Following the completion of the investigation, the Director must review the findings and recommendation to determine whether there is a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by facts and circumstances strong enough to warrant a cautious person to believe that the LAD has been violated. If the Director has not made a probable cause determination within 180 days of the filing of the verified complaint, the complainant may request to litigate the case at the Office of Administrative Law either personally or through private counsel but not by a deputy attorney general.</p>\r\r<h3>Mediation</h3>\r\r<p>Mediation offers parties an opportunity to resolve complaints amicably in the early stages of the administrative process. After a verified complaint is filed with the DCR, the complainant may be sent to mediation. Mediation can occur at various stages during the process, such as, prior to the investigation phase, during the investigation phase, and at other times during the process. When the DCR determines that mediation is appropriate, parties to a complaint meet with an impartial, professionally trained mediator to discuss the case. Over the years, the DCR has successfully resolved a significant number of matters through mediation because it allows both sides to reach a mutually agreeable resolution and to avoid a potentially time-consuming and costly process.</p>\r\r<h3>Conciliation</h3>\r\r<p>Conciliation is a settlement technique where the DCR works with the parties to obtain a remedy to adequately address alleged discrimination. If a finding of probable cause is issued, the parties attend a conciliation conference with a trained DCR negotiator to see if the matter can be resolved. If no agreement can be reached, the matter proceeds to the Office of Administrative Law for a hearing on the merits.</p>\r\r<h3>Hearing at the Office of Administrative Law (OAL)</h3>\r\r<p>If a finding of probable cause is issued, the case will be transmitted to the OAL where a full hearing will take place before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). A state deputy attorney general on behalf of the DCR may litigate the case or the complainant may choose to litigate the case personally or through private counsel. At the hearing, the complainant and respondent present evidence to the ALJ. The parties also present witnesses, which may include the parties themselves, to testify. After a full hearing, the ALJ will render what is called an “initial decision.” In the ALJ’s initial decision, he or she reviews the evidence and makes a determination whether a violation of the law has occurred and, if so, what remedies should be awarded. The DCR Director then reviews this initial decision and any objections filed by the parties. The DCR Director will then issue a final decision that may adopt the initial decision as rendered or modify it. The final order may also approve a settlement agreed upon by the parties, may dismiss the case with a determination that no violation occurred, or find a violation did occur and order the award of appropriate damages which may include an assessment of penalties and other relief deemed proper by the Director.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and New Jersey state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

The individual must contact and file a complaint with an HRB intake officer <i>within 300 days</i> of the employment harm.

If an attorney represents the individual, their attorney must complete the forms. When the individual receives the documents, they need to read the letter, review the documents, sign them, date them, and mail them back to the investigator whose name appears at the end of the letter. It is <u>not</u> a filed charge until the HRB receives the signed forms.</p>\r\r<p>Once the investigator has received the signed and dated documents, it will be an official charge of discrimination that can be investigated. A copy of the charge of discrimination and an invitation to mediation will be sent to the respondent (employer) if the case has been selected for mediation.</p>\r\r<p>The purpose of the mediation is to try and resolve the case. The HRB encourages that all cases go through mediation initially as a means of resolving the charge. If both parties agree to the mediation, an HRB mediator will schedule mediation in the county where the complainant is/was employed and the mediator will meet with both parties. If the mediation is successful, then the case will be closed and both parties will sign a settlement agreement.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>If the complainant’s case is not chosen for mediation, one party or the other is not willing to attend the mediation, or the mediation does not resolve the charge of discrimination, the mediator will then return the case to the investigation unit where it will be assigned to an investigator. The investigator will send the employer a questionnaire asking for their position statement and request information and documentation regarding the allegations.</p>\r\r<p>The employer has 30 days in which they can respond. After the HRB receives the information from the employer, the investigator will provide their position statement and send that to the complainant. The complainant will also have 30 days in which to offer their rebuttal to the respondent’s position statement. When the HRB receives the complainant’s rebuttal, the investigator will evaluate the information in the file and may interview witnesses and/or conduct an on-site investigation if it is necessary. Once the investigation is complete, the investigator will review and summarize the information and forward the case file to the Division Director.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination</h3>\r\r<p>The Division Director will review the case and make a determination of “Probable Cause” or “No Probable Cause.” Probable Cause means that the there is enough evidence to show that the law may have been broken. If the complainant receives a probable cause determination from the Director, both parties will be invited to conciliate the case.</p>\r\r<p>Conciliation, like mediation, is an opportunity for the parties to resolve the matter themselves with the help of a mediator without having to go to a Commission Hearing or to Court. If conciliation does not resolve the matter, then the case will be scheduled to be heard by the New Mexico Human Rights Commission (NMHRC). At this hearing, the complainant will have to prove their allegations of discrimination. The NMHRC does not see or review the investigative file.</p>\r\r<p>The complainant can also request a Hearing Waiver within 60 days, which would allow them to file their case in State District or Federal District Court, rather than go before the NMHRC.</p>\r\r<p>No probable cause means the Director does not believe there was sufficient evidence to show the law was broken. If the complaint gets a no probable cause determination from the Director and the case is only filed with the New Mexico Human Rights Division, then the complainant can file an appeal in State District Court in the county where the alleged discrimination occurred within 30 days from the date of service of the determination.</p>\r\r<p>If the case is dual filed with the EEOC, then the complainant can request a substantial weight review from the EEOC within 90 days of service of the determination, and they can file an appeal with State District Court or Federal District Court, or they can also decide this is the end of their charge and not pursue it any further.</p>\r\r<p>Requesting a substantial weight review does not delay the time to file an appeal in court. The complainant must still file within 90 days of service of the determination. It is important to note that the Human Rights Division does not represent either party in this process. The Human Rights Division’s function is to determine whether the law may have been broken or not. Investigations can last as long as a year.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and New Mexico state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the work place.

The term "discriminate" includes discrimination based on sex, which includes sexual harassment. The HRA applies to all employers within the state who employ <i>1 or more</i> employees for more than 1 quarter of the year and a person, wherever situated, who employs <i>1 or more</i> employees whose services are to be partially or wholly performed in the state.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1001}}</p>\n\n<p>It is a discriminatory practice for a person to conceal unlawful discrimination or aid, abet, compel, coerce, incite, or induce another person to unlawfully discriminate in violation of the HRA, or to engage in any form of threats, retaliation, or discrimination against a person who has opposed any unlawful discriminatory practice or who, in good faith, has filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or litigation under the HRA.</p>\r\r<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>North Dakota defines sexual harassment to include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, sexually motivated physical conduct or other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature when:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol type="a">\r<li>Submission to that conduct or communication is made a term or condition, either explicitly or implicitly, of obtaining employment, public accommodations or public services, or education;\r<li>Submission to, or rejection of, that conduct or communication by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting that individual\'s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing; or\r<li>That conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\'s employment, public accommodations, public services, or educational environment; and in the case of employment, the employer is responsible for its acts and those of its supervisory employees if it knows or should know of the existence of the harassment and fails to take timely and appropriate action.\r</ol></div>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in North Dakota</h2>\r\r<p>The first step in filing a discrimination complaint with the Human Rights Division (HRD) is to complete the “intake” process. This simply means to provide the HRD with initial, specific information about what happened to the complainant. The intake process can be completed in any one of three ways:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>The individual can describe what happened to them in writing using the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1567}} form. Once the form is filled out, sign and date it, and return it to the HRD.\r<li>The individual can contact the HRD and ask to have their intake information taken by telephone.\r<li>The individual’s intake information may be submitted in person. HRD staff is regularly available to meet with individuals in person, by appointment, during regular office hours at the HRD in the State Capitol, or in Fargo by calling {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:708}} to schedule an appointment.\r</ol></div>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:708}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:708}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:708}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:708}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:708}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:708}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:708}}<br>\rTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:708}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:708}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:708}}<br>\rEmail: {{REG_AGENCY_EMAIL:708}}</p>\r\r<p>After the intake process is completed, the HRD will assess the information that was provided to determine whether there is a basis to file a formal discrimination complaint for investigation. The HRD may need to request additional information from the complainant to make this determination. If the intake information provided does establish a basis for a formal complaint, the division will draft a complaint for the complainant to sign. A discrimination complaint is considered filed when the signed complaint is returned to the HRD. Complaints must be filed <i>within 300 days</i> from the date of when the alleged discrimination occurred or ended.</p>\r\r<p>If a complaint is filed with the HRD, the complainant has ninety days from the date the HRD dismisses the action or issues a written “reasonable cause” determination to file in court. In addition, if the complaint is against the State of North Dakota or a state employee and the complainant wishes to seek monetary relief, they must provide written notice of their injury and the amount of relief demanded to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 180 days of the date the alleged discrimination occurred.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>If a formal complaint is filed, the HRD will conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations contained in the complaint. After gathering and reviewing all available evidence, HRD staff will determine whether there is “reasonable cause” to believe that unlawful discrimination occurred. If the allegations are not supported by available evidence, the complaint will be dismissed. If a “reasonable cause” finding is issued, the HRD will provide for an administrative hearing on the complaint to determine what remedy is necessary to correct the effects of the discriminatory practice.</p>\r\r<p>The HRD will emphasize conciliation to resolve complaints. The parties to a complaint may agree to settle the complaint at any time.</p>\r\r<h3>Possible Remedies</h3>\r\r<p>Remedies may include: hiring, reinstatement, promotion, restored benefits, reasonable accommodation, providing assistive devices to make services available, back pay, equitable relief (non-monetary), and injunctions to stop discrimination from recurring. Equitable relief may include attendance of the offending party at educational classes pertaining to discrimination.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF NORTH DAKOTA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "OH" %}\n\n<!--START OF OHIO-->\n\n<h1>Ohio-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of division (A) of the Ohio Civil Rights Act (OCRA).

The OCRC will examine the circumstances of the particular employment relationship and the job functions performed by the individual in determining whether an individual acts in either a supervisory or agency capacity.</p>\r\r<p>With respect to conduct between fellow employees, an employer is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the work place where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct, unless the employer can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p>\r\r<p>An employer may also be responsible for the acts of nonemployees (e.g., customers) with respect to sexual harassment of employees in the work place, where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing these cases the OCRC will consider the extent of the employer\'s control and any other legal responsibility that the employer may have with respect to the conduct of such nonemployees.</p>\r\r<p>The OCRA also specifically states that where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an individual\'s submission to the employer\'s requests for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied that employment opportunity or benefit.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Ohio</h2>\r\r<p>The OCRC has a statute of limitations of 6 months and cannot investigate acts of discrimination that occurred prior to that date. For this reason, all charges of discrimination must be filed <i>within 6 months</i> of the date that the discrimination occurred.</p>\r\r<p>Individuals may file a charge of discrimination with the OCRC by visiting an office in person or completing the charge form on-line.

When BOLI has determined that there is enough information to proceed, BOLI will either send the complainant notice of their filed complaint or prepare a complaint and send that complaint to them for their approval and notarized signature.</p>\r \r<p>A complaint is not considered official until BOLI receives the signed and notarized complaint that contains the necessary elements of a prima facie case under BOLI’s jurisdiction. If the basis for filing a complaint is covered by both state and federal law, a complaint filed with BOLI is automatically filed with the EEOC.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>The BOLI conducts fair and impartial investigations of complaints. The investigator’s job is to find out if discrimination occurred. Investigators do not represent any party involved in the complaint.</p>\r\r<p>After a case is filed, it is assigned to a civil rights senior investigator. The investigator sends a notice to the respondent and to the complainant. The respondent is asked to respond to the allegations contained in the complaint. The investigator will schedule an appointment for the initial complainant’s interview. If the complainant doesn’t complete the interview or cooperate in rescheduling, the complaint will be dismissed.</p>\r\r<p>Generally, an investigator interviews the complainant within 40 days from the date their case is filed with the BOLI. This interview is very important because the information provided determines how the investigator proceeds with the case. The interview covers each discriminatory act stated in the complaint and its date of occurrence. The complainant must be able to tell the investigator how each discriminatory act is linked to the protected class(es). Among other things, the investigator asks the complainant to identify witnesses and comparators. Comparators are other employees or individuals who, in a situation similar to the stated complaint, were either treated the same as the complainant or differently by the respondent.</p>\r\r<p>To prove that discrimination occurred, the complainant must provide substantial evidence. After the interview, the investigator analyzes the information provided by the complainant and the respondent. The case will proceed to further investigation if additional information is needed to determine whether substantial evidence exists to support the allegations. If substantial evidence is found through additional investigation, a “Substantial Evidence Determination” is issued. If no violation is found, the BOLI dismisses the case and notifies the complainant and the respondent of the dismissal.</p>\r\r<p>A complainant can withdraw their complaint at any time during the investigative process. If they want to withdraw their complaint, they need to contact the investigator. The BOLI dismisses the complaint following a withdrawal.</p>\r\r<h3>Conciliation</h3>\r\r<p>If the investigator makes a Substantial Evidence Determination in a case, the BOLI will suggest that the complainant and the respondent try to reach an agreement or conciliation. Conciliation is a voluntary, no-fault settlement of a complaint.</p>\r\r<p>If the complainant and the respondent are able to come to agreement on a settlement, a conciliation agreement is drafted for the parties to sign. This resolves the complaint. When the conciliation agreement is signed, the complaint is closed.</p>\r\r<p>If the conciliation fails, BOLI management reviews the case to decide if it will forward it to a case presenter in BOLI’s Hearing Unit for further action. If the case is assigned, a case presenter reviews the file and decides if the evidence meets the higher standard required for an administrative hearing. Not all Substantial Evidence Determinations meet this standard. If the case presenter decides that the case should receive an administrative hearing, the BOLI will represent the complainant at the hearing without charge.</p>\r\r<p>If either BOLI management or the case presenter decides against an administrative hearing, the case is closed and the complainant is issued a Notice of Complainant’s Right to File a Civil Suit, if not previously issued.</p>\r\r<h3>Administrative Hearing</h3>\r\r<p>An administrative hearing is similar to a court trial and is conducted by an Administrative Law Judge. The Commissioner of the BOLI will issue a final order based on the record of the hearing. If the Commissioner decides in the complainant’s favor, the final order specifies a remedy. A remedy is an award of money or an order to the respondent to compensate the complainant for the effects of the unlawful practice(s).</p>\r\r<p>In cases of discrimination in employment, potential remedies include employment or reemployment, back pay or other benefits lost due to the discriminatory practice, out-of-pocket expenses having to do with the discriminatory practice, and compensation for emotional distress.</p>\r\r<p>If, during the processing of a complaint, the BOLI finds that the respondent has made a settlement offer that provides an effective remedy to the unlawful practice, the BOLI will inform the complainant about the offer. If the complainant doesn’t accept it, the BOLI will close the complaint. In cases where a complaint has been co-filed with the EEOC, the EEOC will determine whether the offer constitutes a full settlement of the federal charge.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF OREGON-->\n\n{% elseif state == "PA" %}\n\n<!--START OF PENNSYLVANIA-->\n\n<h1>Pennsylvania-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA) prohibits employment practices that discriminate against applicants, employees, or independent contractors on the basis of race, color, sex, age (over 40), ancestry, national origin, religious creed, having a GED rather than a high school diploma, handicap or disability, or the use of a guide or support animal for disability, or relationship to a person with a disability. In hospital and healthcare settings, it is illegal to discriminate against employees based on their participation in or refusal to participate in abortion or sterilization procedures.

It is a voluntary, informal process in which a trained, neutral mediator helps people explore and resolve their differences together. The goal is to produce a settlement acceptable to both parties.</p>\r\r<p>Mediators are certified and trained in mediation and the PHRC has trained them specifically in equal employment opportunity law. They are lawyers who work for the state, but are not PHRC employees. Even though they are lawyers, they cannot give legal advice or advocate on behalf of either party. Their role is to remain neutral and encourage communication.</p>\r\r<p>A successful mediation results in a confidential settlement, which both parties have agreed to as a way to resolve their dispute. If mediation is unsuccessful, or if a settlement cannot be reached within 10 days after the complaint is served on the employer, the case returns to the PHRC for investigation.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Pennsylvania state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace.

The respondent may submit a written reply stating his/her position on the charge.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation Overview</h3>\r\r<p>If an allegation is jurisdictional, a formal charge of discrimination is filed and forwarded to the respondent. Investigators conduct an impartial analysis of evidence obtained from both parties; they compare all elements of the case and they attempt to negotiate a resolution/settlement.</p>\r\r<p>At the completion of the investigation a Preliminary Investigating Commissioner (PIC) makes a formal ruling as to whether there is "Probable Cause" or "No Probable Cause" in respect to the allegations of the charge. If no probable cause exists the PIC will dismiss the charge(s).</p>\r\r<p>Upon a Probable Cause ruling, the RICHR attempts to conciliate the matter. The parties have the opportunity to elect to bring the matter to Superior Court. Where conciliation is unsuccessful, and the parties have elected to proceed at the RICHR, an administrative hearing takes place. At the administrative hearing, evidence is admitted and sworn testimony is heard before a Commissioner; a court stenographer is also present. The RICHR renders a formal Decision and Order following an administrative hearing. If discrimination is found, the RICHR orders appropriate remedies and awards appropriate damages.</p>\r\r<h3>Right to Sue</h3>\r\r<p>A complainant may ask for a right to sue in State Court if not less than 120 days and not more than 2 years have elapsed from the date of filing of a charge, if the RICHR has been unable to secure a settlement agreement or conciliation agreement, and if the RICHR has not commenced hearing on a complaint.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Rhode Island state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace.

Sex-based discrimination includes pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, and sexual harassment. The South Carolina Human Affairs Commission (SCHAC) enforces the South Carolina Human Affairs Law.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1013}}</p>\n\n<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>In South Carolina it is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person’s sex. Harassment can include “sexual harassment” or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.</p>\r\r<p>Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a man or a woman by making offensive comments in general about either gender.  Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.</p>\r\r<p>Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).</p>\r\r<p>The harasser can be the victim\'s supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a coworker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in South Carolina</h2>\r\r<p>The anti-discrimination laws give individuals a limited amount of time to file a charge of discrimination. In general, charges filed with the SCHAC need to be filed <i>within 180 calendar days</i> from the day the discrimination took place. If filing with the EEOC, the 180-calendar day filing deadline is extended to <i>300 calendar days</i> and the actual investigation will be conducted by the EEOC.</p>\r\r<p>The first step is to call or come into the office and talk with one of the Intake Investigators. He/she will be able to explain what the SCHAC does and help them to determine if they have a basis for filing a complaint. He/she will give the individual an {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1579}} (also in Spanish {{COURSE_RESOURCE_LANG_FORM:1580}}) to complete, sign, and return.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:726}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:726}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:726}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:726}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:726}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:726}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:726}}<br>\rTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:726}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:726}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:726}}<br>\rEmail: {{REG_AGENCY_EMAIL:726}}</p>\r\r<p>Once the Intake Department receives the written complaint, it will be reviewed to determine if it has a basis for filing a discrimination complaint.

Upon receipt of the completed complaint, it will be assigned a charge number, dual filed with the EEOC, and served on the other party. Charges will be assigned either for mediation, investigation, or transferred to the EEOC.</p>\r\r<h3>Overview of Charge Handling Process</h3>\r\r<p>When a charge is filed, the SCHAC will notify the respondent within 10 days. The SCHAC has a responsibility to investigate and determine whether there is a reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred.</p>\r\r<p>During the investigation, both parties will be asked to provide information. A SCHAC investigator will evaluate the information submitted to determine whether unlawful discrimination has taken place. The respondent may be asked to submit a statement of position. This is their opportunity to tell their side of the story. The respondent must respond to all Requests for Information (RFI). The RFI may ask for submission of copies of personnel policies, complainant’s personnel files, the personnel files of other individuals and other relevant information. The SCHAC may also perform an on-site visit. The investigator may interview other employees or witnesses. The respondent may be present during interviews with management personnel, but an investigator is allowed to conduct interviews of non-management level employees without their presence or permission.</p>\r\r<p>Once the investigator has completed the investigation, the SCHAC will make a determination on the merits of the charge. If the SCHAC determines that there is no reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred, the complainant will be issued a letter called a Dismissal and Notice of Rights that informs them of their right to file a lawsuit in federal court within 90 days from the date of receipt of the letter. The respondent will also receive a copy of this document.</p>\r\r<p>If the SCHAC determines there is reasonable cause to believe discrimination has occurred, both parties will be issued a Letter of Determination stating that there is reason to believe that discrimination occurred and inviting the parties to join the agency in seeking to resolve the charge, through an informal process known as conciliation.</p>\r\r<p>Where conciliation fails, the SCHAC has the authority to enforce violations of its statutes. The complainant will receive a Notice of Right to Sue and may file a lawsuit in federal court within 90 days.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and South Carolina state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace.

This version of the Intake Form can be filled out and sent electronically by clicking on the “Send Electronically” button on the bottom of the last page or can be printed and mailed to the address below.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:727}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:727}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:727}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:727}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:727}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:727}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:727}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:727}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:727}}</p>\r\r<p>The DHR must receive a notarized Charge of Discrimination <i>within 180 days</i> from the last date of discrimination. If the charge is dual-filed (as both a state and federal complaint), the federal deadline <i>is 300 days</i> from the last date of discrimination. This means that, if the charge is more than 180 days but less than 300 days old, the DHR can assist the individual with making a formal charge.</p>\r\r<h3>Complaint Process Overview</h3>\r\r<p>The role of the DHR does <u>not</u> include taking sides. The DHR does not represent the individual filing a charge of discrimination, nor do they defend the party being charged. The DHR\'s job is to act as an independent fact-finder by conducting an investigation to determine whether discrimination took place. The DHR tries to investigate with the least amount of interference, while still fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>\r\r<p>Investigations are often handled by telephone and by mail, but on-site investigations also occur. The DHR typically conducts investigations by voluntary compliance. However, the DHR does have subpoena authority.</p>\r\r<p>Upon completion of an investigation, each party will receive a written report containing a summary and analysis of the facts, and a decision. If the DHR found that discrimination occurred, they will make every attempt to settle the matter. If this effort fails, either party can choose to take the matter to Circuit Court within 20 days. If Circuit Court is not chosen, the matter is scheduled for a public hearing in front of the South Dakota Division of Human Rights, which consists of five members appointed by the Governor.</p>\r\r<h3>Penalties</h3>\r\r<p>Charges of discrimination are civil (not criminal) matters. This means violations of the law cannot be punished by prison sentences. For example, under South Dakota law, if an employer is found to be in violation, the charging party is entitled to "equitable" or "make-whole" relief. This type of relief could include paying lost back wages, obeying cease-and-desist actions, undergoing specific training, or implementing policy changes.</p>\r\r<p>Violations of federal laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, bring stiffer penalties. It is possible the guilty party may have to pay both compensatory damages (payments to make things as if the discrimination had never happened) and punitive damages (payments as punishment).</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF SOUTH DAKOTA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "TN" %}\n\n<!--START OF TENNESSEE-->\n\n<h1>Tennessee-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA) prohibits employment practices that discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and age (over 40 in employment). Discrimination based on sex includes sexual harassment. The law applies to any Tennessee employer, prospective employer, employment agencies or labor organizations <i>with 8 or more</i> employees. Only 1 employee is required in complaints alleging disability or retaliation.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1015}}</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to retaliate against an individual because he or she filed a charge of discrimination, because they complained to his or her employer, housing provider or other covered entity about discrimination, or because they participated in a discrimination proceeding such as an investigation or lawsuit. Retaliation protections exist regardless of the outcome of any discrimination proceeding.</p>\r\r<p>The Tennessee Human Rights Commission (THRC) is an independent state agency that investigates allegations of discrimination in employment. The THRC has adopted the federal regulation defining sexual harassment. Under the adopted rule, sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Submission to the conduct is made a term or condition of employment,\r<li>Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions, or\r<li>The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\'s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Tennessee</h2>\r\r<p>An individual who feels he or she has been illegally discriminated against in employment should file a complaint with the THRC. The complaint must be filed <i>within 180 days</i> after the commission of the alleged discriminatory practice.</p>\r\r<p>The first step in the complaint process is determining if the THRC has jurisdiction and that the alleged act is an unlawful discriminatory act. Each individual that believes they have been illegally discriminated against should call the THRC at {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:728}} and discuss the incident(s). If the THRC staff believes there is sufficient proof of a violation, they will provide the individual with the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1583}} form. The complainant needs to clearly print their answers and statements, sign and date the form, and submit the original form to the THRC.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:728}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:728}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:728}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:728}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:728}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:728}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:728}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:728}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:728}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:728}}</p>\r\r<p>A copy of the complaint and any documents attached to it, except for the witness list, will be forwarded to the respondent, the person or organization that performed the alleged discrimination. The respondent will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegations, and a THRC investigator will be assigned to investigate the complaint.</p>\r\r<p>The THRC staff, or a person designated pursuant to its rules, shall commence an investigation of the complaint within 30 days after the filing of the complaint. The THRC staff, or designee, shall promptly investigate the matter to determine whether the discriminatory practice exists. If it is determined that there is “no reasonable cause” to believe that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, the THRC shall furnish a copy of the order dismissing the complaint to the complainant and the respondent.</p>\r\r<p>If the THRC determines after investigation that there is “reasonable cause” to believe that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, the THRC staff will endeavor to eliminate the alleged discriminatory practices by conference, conciliation, and persuasion.</p>\r\r<p>Mediation is strongly encouraged by the THRC after a complaint has been filed and throughout the entire complaint process. Mediation is an informal negotiation process for settling disputes. The goal is to assist both parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of the issue. It is a free, voluntary, service offered by the THRC. Regardless of the outcome, discussions during mediation remain confidential.</p> \r\r<p>The terms of a conciliation agreement reached with a respondent shall require the respondent to refrain from discriminatory practices in the future, and shall make such further provisions as may be agreed upon between the commission or its assigned staff and the respondent.</p>\r\r<h3>Hearings</h3>\r\r<p>In complaints involving discrimination in employment, within 90 days after an administrative determination of “reasonable cause” to believe that discrimination took place, the THRC shall serve on the respondent by mail or in person a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint as it may have been amended, or a copy of the letter of determination, requiring the respondent to answer the allegation of the complaint at a hearing before a hearing examiner or hearing examiners, or another individual pursuant to its rules, at a time and place specified by the hearing examiner or examiners after conference with the parties or their attorneys.</p>\r\r<h3>Findings and Orders</h3>\r\r<p>If the THRC determines that the respondent has not engaged in a discriminatory practice, the THRC shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. A copy of the order shall be delivered to the complainant, the respondent, and such public officers and persons as the THRC deems proper.</p>\r\r<p>If the THRC determines that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, the THRC shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory practice and to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the THRC. A copy of the order shall be delivered to the respondent, the complainant, and to such public officers and persons as the THRC deems proper.</p>\r\r<p>Affirmative action ordered by the THRC may include, but is not limited to hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees with or without back pay. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable. Remedies may also include payment to the complainant of damages for an injury, including humiliation and embarrassment, caused by the discriminatory practice, and cost, including reasonable attorney\'s fees.</p>\r\r<h3>Right to Sue</h3>\r\r<p>The complainant has the right to hire an attorney and file a civil lawsuit in the state court system, either Chancery or Circuit, at any time during the investigation of their complaint. If they choose this option, they must file suit <i>within 1 year</i> after the alleged discriminatory practice ceases, and prior to any determination being made by the THRC. Unlike federal law, state law does <u>not</u> toll the statute of limitations on a claim while the charge is being investigated and/or mediated by the THRC. The complainant is <u>not</u> required to file a complaint with the THRC, nor do they need the THRC’s permission before they can file suit in Chancery or Circuit court. If the complainant files a civil lawsuit in Chancery or Circuit court, then pursuant to state law, the THRC must administratively close its investigation of their complaint.</p>\r\r<p>If the THRC issues a final determination in the complainant’s case, and they subsequently file a civil lawsuit in state court asserting the same allegations as their THRC complaint, then their case may be dismissed. However, within 30 days of receipt of the THRC’s final determination, the complainant may file a private action in either Chancery or Circuit court appealing the determination.</p>\r\r<h2>Liability</h2>\r\r<p>Effective July 1, 2014, an individual employee or agent of an employer <u>cannot</u> be liable for any violation of the THRA.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Tennessee state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace. In relation to sexual harassment/discrimination, Tennessee requires {{LOCATION:NAME}} to post the bilingual English/Spanish version of the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1584}}/{{COURSE_RESOURCE_LANG_PUBLICATION:1584}} poster where employees can see it.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF TENNESSEE-->\n\n{% elseif state == "TX" %}\n\n<!--START OF TEXAS-->\n\n<h1>Texas-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA) prohibits employment practices that discriminate against individuals on the basis of sex, including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Sex discrimination is when an individual is treated differently than other employees because they are a male or female (including pregnancy) and includes stereotypes and assumptions based on sex. Examples of unlawful actions are denial of hiring, termination, promotion or any other term, condition or privilege of employment. Sexual harassment is generally included in this definition. The TCHRA covers all public employers and private employers <i>with 15 or more</i> employees.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1016}}</p>\n\n<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>In Texas, sexual harassment can be unwelcome advances, requests for sexual favors, or physical touching of a sexual nature. If individuals are subjected to any such behaviors and they unreasonably interfere with their work performance or create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, then that may be sexual harassment. If individuals are subjected to an adverse employment action because they rejected any of those behaviors, that may be sexual harassment. Simple teasing, offhand comments or isolated incidents may not be considered sexual harassment.</p>\r\r<p>Additional considerations:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Sexual harassment can occur whether the harasser is female or male. The harasser does not have to be of the opposite sex.\r<li>The harasser can be a supervisor, an agent of the employer, a supervisor in another area, a coworker or a non-employee.\r<li>Individuals don’t have to be the person harassed, but could be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.\r<li>Unlawful sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to or discharge of the victim.\r<li>The harasser\'s conduct must be unwelcome.\r</ul></div>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Texas</h2>\r\r<p>If any person believes they may have been discriminated against in employment due to their sex or subjected to sexual harassment, they may submit a discrimination complaint through the Texas Workforce Commission, Civil Rights Division (CRD). The CRD conducts neutral investigations and gathers information to determine if discrimination has occurred under the Texas Labor Code. The CRD works in cooperation with the EEOC to resolve employment discrimination allegations.</p>\r\r<p>When an individual submits an employment discrimination complaint with the CRD, it is automatically submitted to the EEOC through a Worksharing Agreement.

The respondent (employer) will also be requested to provide a response to the Charge of Discrimination. The Notice will also include a date for a Resolutions Conference.</p>\r\r<h3>Resolution Conference</h3>\r\r<p>The Resolutions Conference is a voluntary opportunity to mediate a Charge of Discrimination. The Resolutions Conference is informal and voluntary. The purpose of the Resolutions Conference is to bring the parties together, with a mediator provided by the UALD to facilitate communication between the parties who are in disagreement, and see if the differences can be resolved before an investigation. The Resolutions Conference is <u>not</u> a hearing on the facts of the case, and the mediator will <u>not</u> issue a decision on the merits of the case.</p>\r\r<p>Early resolution of the charge has many advantages, some of which include:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>Minimizing the time, energy, and expense which is often required to address a complaint of discrimination.\r<li>Better use of the complainant and respondent’s resources.\r<li>Allowing the complainant and the respondent to decide how a dispute will be resolved without a third party imposing a resolution.\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>Either party may decline to attend the Resolutions Conference, or may leave the Conference at any time. However, all parties are encouraged to make good faith attempts to try to resolve their differences. The UALD requests that both parties bring all information that may support their positions. Witnesses may be used and affidavits (written notarized witness statements) can also be presented.</p>\r\r<p>All issues that reach resolution and all agreements made during the Conference are legal and binding after the UALD Director has signed the agreement. If the Resolutions Conference is successful, the case will be closed. If the parties cannot resolve their issues during the Conference, the case is assigned to an Investigator for further processing.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>If the Resolutions Conference is not successful in settling the case, it will be assigned for investigation. The investigator will conduct any fact-finding that is necessary to make a decision about the facts of the case. This may include:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>Requesting additional information\r<li>Interviewing the complainant\r<li>Interviewing the employer\r<li>Interviewing witnesses\r<li>Doing an on-site inspection of the workplace\r<li>Requesting documents (including personnel files, organizational charts, paycheck stubs, etc.) from the employer\r<li>Requesting documents (including medical records, etc.) from the complainant or the employer\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>A Fact-Finding Conference may also be held. A Fact-Finding Conference is an opportunity for both sides to sit down with the investigator to discuss the case and present their evidence in more detail. A Fact-Finding is not a mini-trial, but rather is an opportunity for the sides to share information, on an informal basis, with the investigator and each other.</p>\r\r<p>After the evidence has been gathered, the UALD will issue a finding of whether or not there is "reasonable cause" or "no reasonable cause" to believe that illegal discrimination has occurred. The parties will receive a copy of the UALD\'s decision.</p>\r\r<p>If the complainant disagrees with the UALD’s decision, they may:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol>\r<li>request an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") with the Utah Labor Commission; \r<li>request a Substantial Weight Review by the EEOC; or\r<li>request a Right to Sue Notice.\r</ol></div>\r\n\n<!--END OF UTAH-->\n\n{% elseif state == "VT" %}\n\n<!--START OF VERMONT-->\n\n<h1>Vermont-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act (VFEPA) prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, ancestry, place of birth, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical or mental condition and HIV status.

This section will only discuss private employment discrimination.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1019}}</p>\n\n<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Vermont defines sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination and means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p> \r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol type="a">\r<li>submission to that conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of employment; or \r<li>submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a component of the basis for employment decisions affecting that individual; or\r<li>the conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\'s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. \r</ol></div>\r\r<H2>{{LOCATION:NAME}} Responsibilities</h2>\r\r<P>{{LOCATION:NAME}} has an obligation to ensure a workplace free of sexual harassment. The state of Vermont requires every employer to:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ol>\r<li>Adopt a policy against sexual harassment, which shall include:\n	<ol type="a">\r<li>a statement that sexual harassment in the workplace is unlawful;\r<li>a statement that it is unlawful to retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint of sexual harassment or for cooperating in an investigation of sexual harassment;\r<li>a description and examples of sexual harassment;\r<li>a statement of the range of consequences for employees who commit sexual harassment;\r<li>if {{LOCATION:NAME}} has <i>more than 5 employees</i>, a description of the process for filing internal complaints about sexual harassment and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the person or persons to whom complaints should be made; and\r<li>the complaint process of the appropriate state and federal employment discrimination enforcement agencies, and directions as to how to contact such agencies.\n</ol>\r</ol></div>\r\r<P>{{LOCATION:NAME}} must provide to all employees an individual written copy of the organization\'s policy against sexual harassment.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Vermont</h2>\r\r<p>Employees or applicants for employment (other than with the state of Vermont) can file discrimination claims with the CRU, under state law, or under both state and federal law. When the CRU receives a complaint (i.e., when a person contacts the CRU and claims his/her rights have been violated), they engage in a screening process. Charges of employment discrimination must be filed <i>within 1 year</i> of the alleged discriminatory act. To file a complaint with the EEOC it must be <i>within 300 days</i> of the last discriminatory act. For state employees, the VHRC\'s deadline for filing a complaint is <i>1 year</i> from the date of the incident.</p>\r\r<p>Once the CRU has determined they have a complaint that relates to potential violation of employment law over which they have jurisdiction, they ask the complainant to complete an {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1588}} outlining the basis for the claim and providing basic information.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:735}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:735}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:735}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:735}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:735}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:735}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:735}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:735}}<br>\rTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:735}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:735}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:735}}<br>\rEmail: {{REG_AGENCY_EMAIL:735}}</p>\r\r<p>When completed questionnaires are returned, they are reviewed to see if a prima facie case is stated, and if so, they draft a charge outlining the basic factual elements stating a violation of law. This charge is forwarded to the complaining party for him/her to review for accuracy, and if accurate and truthful, for him/her to sign before a notary and return to the CRU. Sometimes it is clear, based on the questionnaire itself or on follow up information, that no prima facie case has been stated. In those cases, the CRU does not draft a charge, and they notify the complainant in writing of the decision not to pursue his/her claims.</p>\r\r<p>Once the charge is signed by the individual (Complainant) and returned to the CRU, they open a case file, notify the EEOC of any aspects of the charge that could state a violation of federal law, and send copies of the charge and EEOC notification documents to the employer (Respondent). The respondent is asked to answer the charge, point-by-point, in writing. Both parties may be invited to participate in the CRU’s free mediation program.</p>\r\r<p>On receipt of the respondent’s answer, the file is reviewed to assess whether to proceed with further investigation. In most cases, the respondent’s answer is sent to the complainant for review and a written response. If both parties had expressed interest in mediation, the case may be referred to a mediator at this point.</p>\r\r<p>After the complainant’s response to the respondent’s point-by-point answer is received, the respondent is usually sent a request for additional documentation, including rosters of employees, personnel and time records, personnel evaluations, and the like. Sometimes several documentary requests are made during the investigation. If a respondent does not cooperate, the Attorney General’s office may petition the Superior Court for an order requiring the respondent to comply. Sometimes cases are closed after documentation is received from the respondent, either because it becomes clear that no violation of law can be proven, or because the facts supporting a finding of violation of law are admitted. If additional evidence is needed, a full investigation is conducted.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>A full investigation usually involves interviewing relevant witnesses, reviewing documents on-site as needed, and visiting the worksite. Sometimes parties may be asked to attend a fact-finding session at the office of the Attorney General.</p>\r\r<p>The CRU is willing to engage in settlement discussions at any time in the investigative process. Prior to the issuance of a determination, the CRU usually attempts to reach a conciliated agreement when it appears that there is evidence of a violation of law. The CRU attempts to assist the parties in reaching agreement that is satisfactory to them, and seeks an agreement, on behalf of the public, that ensures adequate training and policy changes to avoid future violations of law, and that compensates the state of Vermont for the cost of the investigation.</p>\r\r<p>After the investigation is completed, if conciliation and other settlement efforts have failed, the CRU issues findings, stating the nature of the charge, the response, the evidence discovered during the investigation, and whether or not there was a violation of law. If no violation of law is found the file is closed at this point.</p>\r\r<p>The Attorney General generally asks the respondent to engage in settlement discussions after a finding that there was a violation of law. Typically, efforts to resolve the case continue for at least 30 days after the issuance of a cause finding.</p>\r\r<p>After finding that there was probably a violation of law, the Attorney General may file a complaint against the respondent in state court, or may seek to intervene in any private action that the complainant has filed. In court, the Attorney General may seek injunctive relief (e.g., reinstatement, training requirements, and so on), back pay awards, front pay awards and damages for the complainant, civil penalties (if applicable), attorney’s fees and costs.</p> \r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Vermont state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace. In relation to sexual harassment/discrimination, Vermont requires {{LOCATION:NAME}} to post in a prominent and accessible location in the workplace the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1589}} poster, which at a minimum, includes the elements of the {{LOCATIONS:NAME}} sexual harassment policy stated above.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF VERMONT-->\n\n{% elseif state == "VA" %}\n\n<!--START OF VIRGINIA-->\n\n<h1>Virginia-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Virginia Human Rights Act (HRA) prohibits employment practices that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, marital status, or disability. Sexual harassment is generally considered discrimination on the basis of sex. The Division of Human Rights (DHR) receives and investigates complaints alleging unlawful discrimination that violates state and federal civil rights laws. \rComplaints alleging discrimination by an employer <i>with 6 to 14 employees</i> fall under state jurisdiction, while employers <i>with 15 or more</i> (20 or more if an age discrimination complaint) fall under federal jurisdiction, which includes discriminatory termination from employment as well as hostile environments and equal pay issues.</p>\r\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1018}}</p>\n\n<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Virginia has a general definition of sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other physical or verbal conduct or communication of a sexual nature, including gender-based harassment that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational or work environment.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Virginia</h2>\r\r<p>Intake is the most crucial point in the entire process. Individuals that believe they have been a victim of a discriminatory act must fill out the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1590}}, sign and date it, and return it to the DHR. The DHR then determines whether the complaint has enough information for it to be accepted procedurally (within applicable statute of limitations period) and substantively (alleges a basis covered by federal or state law). Complaints must be filed <i>within 180 days</i> of the alleged discriminatory event.</p>\r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:736}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:736}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:736}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:736}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:736}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:736}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:736}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:736}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:736}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:736}}<br>\rEmail: {{REG_AGENCY_EMAIL:736}}</p>\r\r<p>It is also an important stage because all notification to the parties emanates from the Intake Officer and (s)he is the first point of contact for the parties. The Intake Officer sets the tone for the rest of the complaint process, must be mindful of time constraints, and makes sure the EEO Managers have a secure foundation in the complaint basis.</p>\r\r<h3>Mediation</h3>\r\r<p>Mediation is the first step in the complaint resolution process. The DHR offers mediation to potentially avoid the need for a lengthy investigation. The process is totally voluntary and has helped the DHR dispose of several complaints that would otherwise be in the investigation inventory.</p>\r\r<p>Mediation is not a fact-finding forum; therefore, the DHR notifies parties that attorneys may be present, but only in a silent, advisory role, except in private, confidential sessions. The parties are introduced to the concept of mediation in a timely manner to make an informed decision about participation. All information discussed and written during the mediation remains confidential and notes are destroyed at its conclusion.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigations</h3>\r\r<p>Should the parties not wish to participate in mediation or the mediation process fails to produce a resolution, the case moves to the investigative stage. To maintain the confidentiality of the mediation, the EEO Manager, having no former participation in the mediation, receives the case for investigation.</p>\r\r<p>This is the point at which the EEO Manager reviews the documentation and witnesses affidavits, conducts on site visits, if necessary, analyzes the evidence, applies the applicable law, and reaches a determination based on the preponderance of the evidence. The EEO Manager will also attempt to conciliate the case if the parties are amenable to the option. Conciliation differs from mediation in that conciliation efforts take place after some kind of fact or fault finding has occurred. Respondents are more conciliatory when they are shown that any part of their business practices is suspect.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination</h3>\r\r<p>If conciliation is not reached, the EEO Managers will issue a Basis for Determination, which outlines in detail all of the procedures followed during the course of the investigation.</p>\r\r<p>The Assistant Attorney General reviews the determination to make sure that the EEO Manager’s decisions are in accordance with the applicable law. Once that determination is made, the Director signs the determination, the original goes to the complainant, and copies are sent to the respondent and the case file.</p>\r\r<h3>Public Hearing</h3>\r\r<p>When conciliation efforts fail, the Director shall set the matter for a public hearing or refer the case to the applicable federal agency. Hearing forum comes into play after there has been no conciliation after the determination phase, and the Director issues a cause finding.</p>\r\r<p>The spirit of the worksharing agreement with the EEOC requires that the DHR exercise its state law to its fullest extent before a referral takes place. Therefore, the public hearing process can be a vital part of the investigative process in those cases where “reasonable cause” to believe that the VHRA has been violated.</p>\r\r<p>A date is set by the DHR for the hearing. A hearing officer is selected from the Virginia Supreme Court’s list of available hearing officers. Space is secured in the General Assembly Building and all parties are given notice of the date and time of the hearing. A court reporter is present during the hearing. Both parties are required to be present at the hearing. The hearing officer hears the evidence presented and renders an opinion. Council members review the opinion and it is their responsibility to secure a majority to either agree or disagree with the hearing officer’s opinion.</p>\r\r<p>The Council members play a vital role in this process because the Council members must make a decision either to affirm or refute the hearing officer’s decision.</p>\r\r<h3>Final Closure</h3>\r\r<p>At this point, all administrative appeals and hearings have been exhausted. The case is closed. If the case was dual filed, notification goes to the EEOC.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF VIRGINIA-->\n\n{% elseif state == "WA" %}\n\n<!--START OF WASHINGTON-->\n\n<h1>Washington-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Washington Law Against Discrimination (LAD) prohibits employment practices that discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, families with children, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability. Sexual orientation means heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and gender expression or identity. As used in this definition, "gender expression or identity" means having or being perceived as having a gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, whether or not that gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the sex assigned to that person at birth. Discrimination on the basis of sex includes sexual harassment. The law covers public employers and private employers <i>with 8 or more</i> employees.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1020}}</p>\n\n<p>The law prohibits taking retaliatory, adverse action against a person who has filed a complaint, a person who has participated in an investigation, or any person who has opposed any practice forbidden by the LAD.</p>\r\r<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>Sexual Harassment is a form of illegal discrimination that violates the Washington State Law Against Discrimination, RCW 49.60, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is illegal for an employer to subject an employee to unwelcome sexual advances, comments or conduct when submission to such conduct is made an implicit or explicit term or condition of employment or used as the basis of employment decisions, or when such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</p>\r\r<p>Harassment may include but is not limited to: unwelcome jokes, comments, gestures; offensive or threatening words; pictures and displays in the work environment, on clothing, sent by email or other media; unwelcome touching, bodily contact or threats, such as grabbing, slapping, shoving, pinching or interfering with an individual\'s freedom of movement; unwelcome requests for dates or flirting; derogatory comments or language against one gender.</p>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment can occur between parties of the same sex; men can be victims of sexual harassment; and women can be harassers. Victims of sexual harassment may also include third parties who are exposed to harassment aimed at another person. Harassers may be coworkers, supervisors, employers, or even non-employees, such as customers, contractors, clients, or vendors.</p>\r\r<H2>{{LOCATION:NAME}} Responsibilities</h2>\r\r<p>Employers, <i>with 8 or more</i> employees, are responsible for having anti-harassment policies and reporting procedures in place. Employers must investigate complaints and take prompt and remedial action to stop the harassment, even when done by a non-employee. Best employment practices include training employees to create a harassment-free climate, provide complaint channels, and making sure that employees are aware of reporting procedures.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Washington</h2>\r\r<p>The Washington State Human Rights Commission (WSHRC) is a state agency responsible for administering and enforcing the LAD. Under the law, everyone has the right to be free from discrimination at work. If any individual believes they are being discriminated against, they need to try to document what is happening. They should keep notes of the dates, times, words used, and actions or conduct they believe is discriminatory. They should keep copies of any relevant letters, answering machine messages, etc. They should also document the names and addresses of any witnesses to the action or situation. The individual (complainant) has a responsibility to act in a timely manner. Under the LAD, they must file a formal employment complaint with the WSHRC <i>within 6 months</i> of the alleged discriminatory incident or action.</p>\r\r<p>All incoming complaints go through an intake process staffed by professional customer service representatives and civil rights investigators, and overseen by an experienced manager. Many potential complaints are turned away as not being timely, not being in their jurisdiction, not alleging an incident which if true would violate the Washington LAD, or are not filed by a person with standing.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals need to completely fill out the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1591}} and mail it to the WSHRC {{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:737}} address below or schedule an appointment at a local office by calling {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:737}}.</p>\r\n\n<table align="center" border="0">  \n<thead>  \n<tr>  \n<th colspan="2" scope="col" style="text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:737}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:737}})<br> \nWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:737}} \n</th>		  \n</tr>  \n</thead> \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:737}}</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS2:737}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:737}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:737}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:737}}<br> \nPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:737}}<br> \nTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:737}}<br> \nFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:737}}   \n</td>  \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:738}}</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:738}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:738}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:738}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:738}}<br> \nPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:738}}<br> \nTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:738}}<br> \nFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:738}} \n</td> \n</tr>  \n<tr> \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:739}}</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:739}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:739}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:739}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:739}}<br> \n</td> \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:740}}</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:740}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:740}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:740}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:740}}<br> \nPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:740}}<br> \nFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:740}} \n</td> \n</tr> \n<tr> \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n<b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:741}}</b><br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:741}}<br> \n{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:741}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:741}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:741}} \n</td> \n<td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;padding:3px 10px;">\n&nbsp; \n</td> \n</tr> \n</tbody>  \n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class="callout callout-blue">\n<h4>NOTE:</h4> \r\r<p>Due to state budget reductions, the {{REG_AGENCY_CITY:738}}, {{REG_AGENCY_CITY:739}}, {{REG_AGENCY_CITY:741}} offices no longer are available for walk-in appointments.

The WSHRC is not an advocate for either side. The WSHRC’s role under the law is to gather facts about the situation and then determine whether there is cause to believe that discrimination occurred. The WSHRC will send a written notice to the person(s) alleged to have committed the act of discrimination. After an initial interview, the investigator will determine if there is a prima facie claim of discrimination that merits a full investigation. If there is a prima facie claim, a WSHRC Investigator will investigate the complaint by gathering more evidence, interviewing witnesses, or conducting site visits. It can take some time to complete a thorough investigation. Whenever appropriate, the WSHRC will meet with both sides to explore resolving the issues. Settlement is often a quicker and more satisfactory way to resolve the complaint.</p>\r\r<p>Upon completion of the investigation, the WSHRC will issue a finding. If the evidence does not support the charge of discrimination, the WSHRC will issue a finding of "no reasonable cause" to believe discrimination occurred. If the WSHRC finds that there is “reasonable cause” to believe discrimination occurred, they will seek conciliation of the complaint. Appropriate remedies in the conciliation process may include back pay, reinstatement, or training to eliminate the unfair practice. If conciliation fails, the complaint may be turned over to the Attorney General\'s office for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. The Commissioners may grant reconsideration if the party can show that there was a misapplication of the law, or that relevant information provided during the investigation was not considered in the finding.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Washington state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace. In relation to sexual harassment/discrimination, Washington has a <i>recommended</i> English version of the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1592}} poster that should be posted so it can easily be seen and read by employees; the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_LANG_PUBLICATION:1593}} poster is also available in Spanish.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF WASHINGTON-->\n\n{% elseif state == "WV" %}\n\n<!--START OF WEST VIRGINIA-->\n\n<h1>West Virginia-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The West Virginia Human Rights Act (HRA) prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age, blindness or disability. The West Virginia Supreme Court has ruled that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination under the state Human Rights Act.</p>\n\n<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:1022}}</p>\n\n<p>The HRA applies to all public and private employers employing <i>12 or more</i> persons within the state for 20 or more calendar weeks in the calendar year in which the act of discrimination allegedly took place or the preceding calendar year.</p>\r\r<p>It is unlawful to engage in any form of threats or reprisal, or to hire or conspire with others to commit acts or activities of any nature, when the purpose of which is to harass, degrade, embarrass or cause physical harm or economic loss, or to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce any person to engage in any of the unlawful discriminatory practices defined in the HRA.</p>\r\r<p>It is unlawful to willfully obstruct or prevent any person from complying with the provisions of the HRA, or to resist, prevent, impede or interfere with the HRA or any of its members or representatives in the performance of a duty under the HRA.</p>\r\r\r<p>It is also unlawful to engage in any form of reprisal or otherwise discriminate against any person because he or she has opposed any practices or acts forbidden under the HRA or because he or she has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under the HRA.</p>\r\r<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>\r\r<p>When it occurs in the workplace, harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of W. Va. Code §5-11-9 (a) (1). The HRA affords employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, or insult.</p>\r\r<p>West Virginia defines sexual harassment as any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature and constitute sexual harassment when:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol type="a">\r<li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual\'s employment or is exchanged for job benefits;\r<li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or\r<li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\'s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\r</ol></div>\r\r<p>In determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment, the West Virginia Human Rights Commission (WVHRC) will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred. The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts, on a case-by-case basis, but in all cases the harassment complained of must be sufficiently severe or pervasive.</p>\r\r<p>In determining whether alleged sexual harassment in a particular case is sufficiently severe or pervasive, the WVHRC will consider:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>Whether it involved unwelcome physical touching;\r<li>Whether it involved verbal abuse of an offensive or threatening nature;\r<li>Whether it involved unwelcome and consistent sexual innuendo or physical contact; and\r<li>The frequency of the unwelcome and offensive encounters.\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>A person who has been harassed on an isolated basis may offer evidence of harassment suffered by other employees as proof that the harassment was pervasive or severe.</p>\r\r<p>Harassment is not necessarily confined to unwanted sexual conduct. Hostile or physically aggressive behavior may also constitute sexual harassment, as long as the disparate treatment is based on gender.</p>\r\r<H2>{{LOCATION:NAME}} Liability</h2>\r\r<P>{{LOCATION:NAME}} is responsible for its acts and those of its officers, agents and supervisory employees with respect to sexual harassment regardless of whether the specific acts complained of were authorized or even forbidden by {{LOCATION:NAME}} and regardless of whether the organization knew or reasonably should have known of their occurrence, except that the organization is not responsible if the officer, agent or supervisory employee was acting outside of the scope of his/her employment.</p> \r\r<p>The WVHRC will examine the circumstances of the particular employment relationship and the job functions performed by the individual in determining whether an individual acted as an officer, or in either a supervisory or agency capacity, and acted within or outside of the scope of his/her employment.</p>\r\r<p>With respect to conduct between fellow employees, {{LOCATION:NAME}} is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace where the organization (or its agents or supervisory employees) knew or reasonably should have known of such conduct, or expressly or impliedly authorized or ratified such conduct. As a defense, {{LOCATION:NAME}} may show that it took timely and appropriate corrective action regarding such conduct.</p>\r\r<P>{{LOCATION:NAME}} may also be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees in the workplace, where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knew or should have reasonably known of the conduct and failed to take timely and appropriate corrective action.</p>\r\r<p>Where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an individual’s submission to an employer’s sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied that employment opportunity or benefit.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in West Virginia</h2>\r\r<p>A person may call, write or visit the office of the WVHRC to report an incident of discrimination. The complaint must be filed <i>within 365 days</i> of the date of the most recent date of discrimination. Individuals must fill out the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1594}}, print it, sign it, and then mail it to the address located at the top of the form (see below).</p> \r\r<p align="center"><b>{{REG_AGENCY_NAME:742}} ({{REG_AGENCY_ACRONYM:742}})</b><br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_ADDRESS1:742}}<br>\r{{REG_AGENCY_CITY:742}}, {{REG_AGENCY_STATE:742}} {{REG_AGENCY_ZIP:742}}<br>\rPhone: {{REG_AGENCY_PHONE:742}}<br>\rTDD Phone: {{REG_AGENCY_TTY_PHONE:742}}<br>\rFax: {{REG_AGENCY_FAX:742}}<br>\rWebsite: {{REG_AGENCY_WEBSITE:742}}</p>\r\r<p>The WVHRC uses the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1594}} (EBIF) to guide the development of a complaint, if no written complaint is provided. It is also used by the investigators in the investigatory process as a source of narrative information from the complainant. After the EBIF has been examined and found to meet the rules of the WVHRC, a formal complaint is drafted; the complainant must sign this formal complaint.</p> \r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>The investigatory process begins with service of the complaint upon the responding party. The respondent must answer the complaint with a response, or position statement; this statement is helpful to the investigatory process when it contains a statement of facts and an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the allegations of the complaint. Respondents may also decide to include documents or other evidence that is related to the complaint and that the respondent would like the WVHRC to consider during the course of its investigation. The response, or position statement, is the respondent’s first opportunity to assert its position to the investigators.</p>\r\r<p>The WVHRC’s investigatory process typically proceeds by asking the complainant to provide a rebuttal to the respondent’s position statement. The rebuttal is the complainant’s opportunity to provide input into the shape of the investigation. A well-crafted position statement can give the WVHRC information that can trigger additional investigatory steps. To the extent it is known to the complainant, comparator information tends to be very helpful to investigators.</p>\r\r<p>There are a variety of ways the WVHRC can obtain additional information in an investigation. The WVHRC may conduct interviews of witnesses or take depositions of such persons, issue interrogatories or questionnaires, and request the production of documents.</p>\r\r<h3>Determination</h3>\r\r<p>The conclusion of the investigation is published to the parties through the issuance of a Letter of Determination (LOD). The LOD identifies whether the evidence obtained throughout the course of the WVHRC’s investigation supports a determination of “probable cause” or “no probable cause.”</p>\r\r<p>If the WVHRC finds no probable cause, an “NPC” LOD is issued to the parties along with an explanation of the complainant’s right to request an administrative review of the determination. Such requests must be made in writing and should be submitted to the executive director or compliance director of the WVHRC. Administrative reviews are granted at the discretion of the executive director, and are currently conducted by the Civil Rights Division. Upon review of the information submitted, the investigatory file and the attorney’s recommendation, the executive director issues a decision, and may send the case back for further investigation, uphold the NPC, or reverse the NPC determination and enter a probable cause determination.</p>\r\r<p>A final determination of no probable cause results in the dismissal of a Human Rights Commission case, without prejudice to the claim. A notice of right to sue in circuit court accompanies the dismissal. While an upheld or uncontested no probable cause determination concludes the WVHRC’s proceedings with regard to a complaint, such a dismissal is not res judicata on the claim, since adjudication of the claim has not occurred. The same claim may be filed in circuit court.</p>\r\r<h3>Conciliation</h3>\r\r<p>Like many dispute resolution systems, the WVHRC encourages voluntary settlement in all phases of the investigation and adjudication. Conciliation is provided for in W. Va. Code §§ 5-11-8 and 5-11-10. The WVHRC currently engages in predetermination conciliation (PDC), and invites the parties to participate in conciliation in advance of the WVHRC issuing a determination upon the complaint. Early in the investigative process, the parties are provided information about conciliation and are invited to let the WVHRC know if they are interested in the process. Conciliation can allow for early settlements when both parties are interested in resolution. It can also be attractive to respondents, inasmuch as the PDC process can occur prior to any formal determination being published. The HRA requires that conciliation agreements remain confidential, at least as to the identities of the parties.</p>\r\r<h3>Adjudication of Probable Cause Complaints</h3>\r\r<p>Unresolved probable cause cases are referred to the WVHRC’s Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) division so that a public hearing may be set. The case is assigned to an administrative law judge, and a scheduling order is issued. The respondent has 10 days after receipt of the public hearing notice to file a verified answer. This answer is required in addition to any previously filed investigatory answer or position statement.</p>\r\r<p>Complainants who are not represented by private lawyers work with the Civil Rights Division of the Office of the Attorney General on the development and litigation of their cases. If private counsel represents the complainant and the WVHRC has no independent interest in the matter, the case in support of the complaint is typically presented solely by the complainant’s attorney. A respondent may appear with or without counsel. Procedural Rule 7.9. provides that attorneys shall file a notice of appearance with the administrative law judge, and having done so shall remain that party’s attorney until withdrawing or revoking the representation.</p>\r\r<h3>Public Hearings</h3>\r\r<p>Hearings are conducted on the record before a WVHRC ALJ. Testimony is sworn and may be obtained by subpoena. The Rules of Evidence apply. WVHRC hearings are conducted in the county where the respondent resides or conducts business at a place designated by the ALJ. Hearings are open to the public except in extraordinary circumstances.</p> \r\r<h3>Remedies</h3>\r\r<p>The HRA provides for substantial consequences for violations of the law. In the administrative context, complainants may be awarded such relief as will effectuate the purposes of the Human Rights Act and "make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.” Compensatory and equitable relief should be granted to the fullest extent possible because of the remedial nature of the HRA. Such relief includes back pay, reinstatement and front pay.</p>\r\r<p>Cases before the WVHRC involve both individual harm and the public interest. In addition to damages that compensate for lost employment, complainants are also entitled to other relief, including cease and desist orders and other equitable relief. The HRA provides for the issuance of cease and desist orders. In addition to the make whole remedy available to a complainant, cease and desist orders may contain provisions which will aid in eliminating future discrimination.</p>\r\r<p>The WVHRC may also award incidental damages as compensation for humiliation, embarrassment, emotional and mental distress, and loss of personal dignity, without proof of monetary loss.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and West Virginia state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace.

Sexual harassment includes conduct directed by a person at another person of the same or opposite gender. Unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature includes but is not limited to the deliberate, repeated making of unsolicited gestures or comments of a sexual nature; the deliberate, repeated display of offensive sexually graphic materials which is not necessary for business purposes; or deliberate verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, whether or not repeated, that is sufficiently severe to interfere substantially with an employee\'s work performance or to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</p>\r\r<H2>{{LOCATION:NAME}} Liability</h2>\r\r<p>For purposes of sexual harassment claims, {{LOCATION:NAME}} is presumed liable for an act of sexual harassment by the organization or by any of its employees or members, if the act occurs while the complaining employee is at his or her place of employment or is performing duties relating to his or her employment, if the complaining employee informs the organization, and if the organization fails to take appropriate action within a reasonable time.</p>\r\r<h2>Filing a Complaint in Wisconsin</h2>\r\r<p>A person, who believes he or she is a victim of unlawful employment discrimination, may file a complaint with the Equal Rights Division (ERD) <i>within 300 days</i> of the discriminatory action. Individuals mail their completed and signed {{COURSE_RESOURCE_FORM:1596}}/{{COURSE_RESOURCE_LANG_FORM:1597}} form.

The investigator acts impartially and independently, and represents neither the complainant (person filing the complaint) nor the respondent (employer being complained against). The investigator cannot give legal advice to the parties. An attorney should be contacted if either party needs legal advice.</p> \r\r<p>After the ERD receives a complaint, a copy is sent to the respondent, who must provide a written answer to the complaint. The investigator may contact the complainant after receiving this answer and may want more information from the parties or any witnesses. The investigator may ask the parties if they want to resolve the case through a settlement.</p>\r\r<h3>Consider Settlement</h3>\r\r<p>Settlement is often a good option for both parties. The ERD staff is trained to assist the parties in working out a fair and equitable resolution and in drafting a voluntary agreement. The parties should seriously consider the merits of settlement at any time in the process, even up to the day of a formal hearing.</p> \r\r<p>If a case is not settled, the equal rights officer will complete an investigation and then write an initial determination of whether there is “Probable Cause” or “No Probable Cause” to believe that the law has been violated.</p>\r\r<p>Probable Cause (PC) is not a finding of discrimination. It means there was enough believable information about discrimination to send the case on for a hearing on its merits. A No Probable Cause (NPC) finding means there was not enough evidence of discrimination. It does not always mean there was no discrimination. The case is dismissed, unless the complainant files a written appeal within 30 days.</p>\r\r<h3>Hearings</h3>\r\r<p>Discrimination hearings are similar to a court proceeding. Both parties present evidence under oath before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ reviews the evidence and hears testimony of witnesses, then issues a decision on whether or not discrimination occurred. All relevant evidence and testimony must be presented at this hearing. It is the only chance for the parties to do so. Information given earlier to the investigator is not considered at the hearing. The ALJ cannot represent either party. Legal counsel may be advisable at this point, but is not required.</p>\r\r<h3>Remedies</h3>\r\r<p>If a complainant proves discrimination under state law, an ALJ can award wages lost, interest on lost wages, attorney fees and costs. A job offer may also be ordered, if appropriate. Either party may appeal the ALJ\'s decision. Additional relief for damages, such as humiliation and emotional pain, or for punitive damages may be awarded, but only if a case is filed in federal court.</p>\r\r<h2>Required Postings</h2>\r\r<p>Federal and Wisconsin state laws require that certain posters be displayed in the workplace. In relation to sexual harassment/discrimination, Wisconsin requires {{LOCATION:NAME}} to post the English version of the fair employment posting {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1598}}, which is also available in Spanish ({{COURSE_RESOURCE_LANG_PUBLICATION:1599}}). All employers who are health care providers or who own or manage a health care facility must also post the {{COURSE_RESOURCE_PUBLICATION:1600}} poster in one or more conspicuous places where notices to employees are customarily posted.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF WISCONSIN-->\n\n{% elseif state == "WY" %}\n\n<!--START OF WYOMING-->\n\n<h1>Wyoming-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\n\n<p>The Wyoming Fair Employment Practices Act of 1965 (WFEPA) prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age, sex, race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, or pregnancy. Discrimination based on "sex" or "gender" under WFEPA includes sexual harassment. The Wyoming Supreme Court has ruled that sexual harassment is included in the WFEPA\'s prohibition of discrimination based on sex (<i>Hoflund v. Airport Golf Club</i>, 105 P.3d 1079 (Wy. 2005)).

If the complaint falls within the WFEP’s jurisdiction, a Draft Charge is sent to the complainant. The charge needs to be reviewed by the complainant and then signed and notarized and sent back to the WFEP office; the complaint is now a formal complaint.</p>\r\r<p>The respondent is served with a copy of the complaint within 10 days of receipt by the WFEP office and they are given 14 days to respond. The complainant is then allowed to rebut the respondent’s response.</p>\r\r<h3>Investigation</h3>\r\r<p>The formal complaint is assigned to a Compliance Officer for investigation. The WFEP’s Compliance Officer investigates by way of fact-finding actions and tries to get both parties to come together for a Settlement Conference. If the case is resolved at the conference, the case is closed. If the case cannot be resolved in a Settlement Conference, the investigation continues and the Compliance Officer makes a determination.</p>\r\r<p>A “No Reasonable Cause” determination issued by the Compliance Officer means there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a claim of discrimination and the case is closed. The complainant has 20 days to ask for hearing under state law, or 15 days to ask the EEOC for a review of the investigation if the charge is dual filed under state and federal laws.</p>\r\r<p>A “Reasonable Cause” determination issued by the Compliance Officer means there is sufficient evidence to warrant a claim of discrimination. The Compliance Officer again tries to get both parties to conciliate and avoid litigation.</p>\r\r<p>If both parties sign a conciliation agreement, the case is settled and closed. If both parties do not sign a conciliation agreement, the case proceeds on to further conciliation efforts, litigation on behalf of the complainant, and a Right-to-Sue in Federal District Court or a hearing under state law.</p>\r\r<p>Generally, the complainant has the burden to show that the employer has violated the laws enforced by the WFEP. The complainant must supply specific evidence, i.e., names, approximate dates, and possible witnesses to the events, that suggests unlawful discrimination has occurred. The WFEP/EEOC reserves the right to decide how to investigate, how far to investigate, and what determination to make on any charge. If the WFEP/EEOC does not find in the complainant’s favor, they have the right to pursue their claim through legal action on their own.</p>\r\r<p>The WFEP/EEOC also decides what priority to give a case, based on the information supplied and their experience in such matters. Some cases are investigated immediately, but complainants should also be prepared to wait several months for the investigation to start.</p>\r\r<p>When the WFEP investigates, they might interview witnesses and the employer\'s representatives, review records and documents, and contact other sources and witnesses not named by the supplied information. The WFEP/EEOC tries to protect employees currently working for the employer, and such witnesses can be talked to confidentially if they wish. If there are other employees who were affected by the circumstances in the case, the WFEP might expand the investigation to include their circumstances.</p>\r\r<p>If the complainant feels they have been retaliated against for filing a charge, they need to discuss this with an investigator. Discrimination law prohibits retaliation for asserting individual civil rights by filing a charge or participation in an investigation.</p>\r\r<p>The WFEP/EEOC does not act as a representative or attorney for either side, and cannot give legal advice. It is up to the complainant whether or not to hire an attorney. A settlement, either directly between the complainant and the employer or through the mediation service offered by the WFEP/EEOC, is one way to get early action on the charge. A settlement usually requires compromises by both sides. The WFEP/EEOC cannot force the employer to agree to the terms of a settlement, which is voluntary, unless a suit has been filed and won. If a complainant is out of work because of the events in their charge, their search for work could have bearing on any future damages. They should keep a record of where and when they look for work and what interim work they have obtained.</p>\r\n\n<!--END OF WYOMING-->\n\n{% else %}\n\n<!--THIS IS WHAT DISPLAYS IF NO MATCHING STATE-->\n\n<h1>State/Province-Specific Laws and Regulations</h1>\r\r<p>The state or province of {{LOCATION:CITY}}, {{LOCATION:STATE_LONGNAME}} does not have any specific laws/regulations that pertain to sexual harassment, which means employees at {{LOCATION:NAME}} fall under the federal jurisdiction of the EEOC.</p>\r\r<p>Sexual harassment lawsuits are stressful and expensive.

The EEOC\'s information below examines those decisions and provides practical guidance regarding the duty of employers to prevent and correct harassment and the duty of employees to avoid harassment by using their employer’s complaint procedures.</p> \r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:957}}</p>\r\r<p>In <i>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</i>, 118 S. Ct. 2257 (1998), and <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</i>, 118 S. Ct. 2275 (1998), the Supreme Court made clear that employers are subject to vicarious liability for unlawful harassment by supervisors. The standard of liability set forth in these decisions is based on two principles: 1) an employer is responsible for the acts of its supervisors, and 2) employers should be encouraged to prevent harassment and employees should be encouraged to avoid or limit the harm from harassment. In order to accommodate these principles, the Supreme Court held that an employer is <i>always</i> liable for a supervisor’s harassment if it culminates in a tangible employment action. However, the employer may be able to avoid liability or limit damages by establishing an affirmative defense that includes two necessary elements:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol>\r<li>The employer exercised <i>reasonable</i> care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior; and\r<li>The employee <i>unreasonably</i> failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\r</ol></div>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>NOTICE:</h4>\r\r<p>The standard for employer liability for hostile work environment harassment depends typically on whether or not the harasser is the victim’s <b>supervisor</b>. An employer is vicariously liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor. In <i>Vance v. Ball State University</i>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013), the Supreme Court rejected in part the EEOC’s definition of “supervisor.” The Supreme Court held that an employee is a “supervisor” if the employer has empowered that employee “to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a ‘significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.’” The Supreme Court stated that an employer <i>is liable</i> for hostile work environment harassment by employees who are <u>not</u> supervisors if the employer was “negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place.” In assessing such negligence, the Supreme Court explained, “the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor to be considered in determining whether the employer was negligent.” Also relevant is “evidence that an employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from being filed.”</p>\n</div>\r\r<p>While the <i>Faragher</i> and <i>Ellerth</i> decisions addressed sexual harassment, the Supreme Court’s analysis drew upon standards set forth in cases involving harassment on other protected bases. Moreover, the EEOC has always taken the position that the same basic standards apply to all types of prohibited harassment. Thus, the standard of liability set forth in the decisions applies to all forms of unlawful harassment.</p>\r\r<p>While the anti-discrimination statutes seek to remedy discrimination, their primary purpose is to prevent violations. The Supreme Court, in <i>Faragher</i> and <i>Ellerth</i>, relied on the EEOC’s guidance that has long advised employers to take all necessary steps to prevent harassment. The new affirmative defense gives credit for such preventive efforts by an employer, thereby “implementing clear statutory policy and complementing the Government’s Title VII enforcement efforts.”</p>\r\r<p>The question of liability arises only after there is a determination that unlawful harassment occurred. Harassment does <u>not</u> violate <i>federal</i> law unless it involves discriminatory treatment on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age of 40 or older, disability, or protected activity under the anti-discrimination statutes. Furthermore, the anti-discrimination statutes are <u>not</u> a “general civility code.” Thus <i>federal</i> law does <u>not</u> prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not “extremely serious.” Rather, the conduct must be “so objectively offensive as to alter the ‘conditions’ of the victim’s employment.” The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminated in a tangible employment action or was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.

However, agency principles “may not be transferable in all their particulars” to the federal employment discrimination statutes. The determination of whether an individual has sufficient authority to qualify as a “supervisor” for purposes of vicarious liability cannot be resolved by a purely mechanical application of agency law. Rather, the purposes of the anti-discrimination statutes and the reasoning of the Supreme Court decisions on harassment must be considered.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:958}}</p>\r\r<p>The Supreme Court, in <i>Faragher</i> and <i>Ellerth</i>, reasoned that vicarious liability for supervisor harassment is appropriate because supervisors are aided in such misconduct by the authority that the employers delegated to them. Therefore, that authority must be of a sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment. The determination as to whether a harasser had such authority is based on his or her job function rather than job title (e.g., “team leader”) and must be based on the specific facts.</p>\r\r<p>An individual qualifies as an employee’s “supervisor” if:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ul>\r<li>the individual has authority to undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee; or\r<li>the individual has authority to direct the employee’s daily work activities.\r</ul></div>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>Authority to Undertake or Recommend Tangible Employment Actions</h4>\r\r<p>An individual qualifies as an employee’s “supervisor” if he or she is authorized to undertake tangible employment decisions affecting the employee. <b>“Tangible employment decisions” are decisions that significantly change another employee’s employment status.</b> Such actions include, but are not limited to, hiring, firing, promoting, demoting, and reassigning the employee. As the Supreme Court stated, “tangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor.”</p>\r\r<p>An individual whose job responsibilities include the authority to recommend tangible job decisions affecting an employee qualifies as his or her supervisor even if the individual does not have the final say.

Furthermore, someone who directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments would not qualify as a “supervisor.” For example, an individual whose delegated authority is confined to coordinating a work project of limited scope is not a “supervisor.”</p>\r\r<h3>Harasser Outside Supervisory Chain of Command</h3>\r\r<p>In some circumstances, an employer may be subject to vicarious liability for harassment by a supervisor who does not have actual authority over the employee. Such a result is appropriate if the employee reasonably believed that the harasser had such power. The employee might have such a belief because, for example, the chain of command is unclear. Alternatively, the employee might reasonably believe that a harasser with broad delegated powers has the ability to significantly influence employment decisions affecting him or her even if the harasser is outside the employee’s chain of command.</p>\r\r<p>If the harasser had no actual supervisory power over the employee, and the employee did not reasonably believe that the harasser had such authority, then the standard of liability for <i>coworker harassment</i> applies.</p>\r', 17, 150, 1, NULL, NULL),

The Supreme Court recognized that this result is appropriate because an employer acts through its supervisors, and a supervisor’s undertaking of a tangible employment action constitutes an act of the employer.</p>\r\r<h3>Tangible Employment Action</h3>\r\r<p>A tangible employment action is “a significant change in employment status.” <i>Unfulfilled threats are insufficient</i>. Characteristics of tangible employment actions are:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-blue">\r<ol>\r<li>A tangible employment action is the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates, as demonstrated by the following:\n<ul>\r<li>it requires an official act of the enterprise;\r<li>it usually is documented in official company records;\r<li>it may be subject to review by higher level supervisors; and\r<li>it often requires the formal approval of the enterprise and use of its internal processes.\n</ul>\r<li>A tangible employment action usually inflicts direct economic harm.\r<li>A supervisor or other person acting with the authority of the company can only cause a tangible employment action, in most instances.\r</ol></div>\r\r<p>Examples of tangible employment actions include:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<ul>\r<li>hiring and firing;\r<li>promotion and failure to promote;\r<li>demotion;\r<li>undesirable reassignment;\r<li>a decision causing a significant change in benefits;\r<li>compensation decisions; and\r<li>work assignment.\r</ul></div>\r\r<p>Any employment action qualifies as “tangible” if it results in a significant change in employment status. For example, significantly changing an individual’s duties in his or her existing job constitutes a tangible employment action <i>regardless of whether the individual retains the same salary and benefits</i>. Similarly, altering an individual’s duties in a way that blocks his or her opportunity for promotion or salary increases also constitutes a tangible employment action.</p>\r\r<p>On the other hand, an employment action does <u>not</u> reach the threshold of “tangible” if it results in only an <i>insignificant change</i> in the complainant’s employment status. For example, altering an individual’s job title does <u>not</u> qualify as a tangible employment action if there is <i>no</i> change in salary, benefits, duties, or prestige, and the only effect is a bruised ego. However, if there were a significant change in the status of the position because the new title is less prestigious and thereby effectively constitutes a demotion, a tangible employment action would be found.</p>\r\r<p>If a supervisor undertakes or recommends a tangible job action based on a subordinate’s response to unwelcome sexual demands, the employer is liable and <u>cannot</u> raise the affirmative defense. The result is the same whether the employee rejects the demands and is subjected to an adverse tangible employment action or submits to the demands and consequently obtains a tangible job benefit. Such harassment previously would have been characterized as “quid pro quo.” It would be a perverse result if the employer is <i>barred</i> from raising the affirmative defense if its supervisor <i>denies</i> a tangible job benefit based on an employee’s rejection of unwelcome sexual demands, but <i>can</i> raise the defense if its supervisor <i>grants</i> a tangible job benefit based on submission to such demands. The EEOC rejects such an analysis. In both the aforementioned situations the supervisor undertakes a tangible employment action on a discriminatory basis. The Supreme Court stated that there must be a <i>significant change</i> in employment status; it did <u>not</u> require that the change be <i>adverse</i> in order to qualify as tangible.</p>\r\r<p>If a challenged employment action is not “tangible,” it may still be considered, along with other evidence, as part of a hostile environment claim that is subject to the affirmative defense. In <i>Ellerth</i>, the Supreme Court concluded that there was no tangible employment action because the supervisor never carried out his threats of job harm. <i>Ellerth</i> could still proceed with her claim of harassment, but the claim was properly “categorized as a hostile work environment claim which requires a showing of severe or pervasive conduct.”</p>', 18, 260, 1, NULL, NULL),

While a notice-based negligence standard would absolve the employer of liability, the standard set forth in <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher</i> does not. As the Supreme Court explained, vicarious liability sets a “more stringent standard” for the employer than the “minimum standard” of negligence theory.</p>\r\r<p>While this result may seem harsh to a law-abiding employer, it is consistent with liability standards under the anti-discrimination statutes that generally make employers responsible for the discriminatory acts of their supervisors.</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>\r\r<p>If a supervisor rejects a candidate for promotion because of national origin-based bias, the employer will be liable regardless of whether the employee complained to higher management and regardless of whether higher management had any knowledge about the supervisor’s motivation. <i>Harassment is the only type of discrimination carried out by a supervisor for which an employer can avoid liability</i>, and that limitation must be construed narrowly. The employer will be shielded from liability for harassment by a supervisor only if it proves that it exercised <i>reasonable</i> care in preventing and correcting the harassment and that the employee <i>unreasonably</i> failed to avoid all of the harm.

Similarly, a staffing firm worker who is harassed at the client’s workplace might report the harassment either to the staffing firm or to the client, reasonably expecting that either would act to correct the problem. Thus the worker’s failure to complain to one of those entities would not bar him or her from subsequently bringing a claim against it.</p></div>\r\r<p>With these and any other efforts to avoid harm, the timing of the complaint could affect liability or damages. If the employee could have avoided some of the harm by complaining earlier, then damages would be mitigated accordingly.</p>\r\r<h2 align="center">Harassment by “Alter Ego” of Employer</h2>\r\r<h3>Standard of Liability</h3>\r\r<p>An employer is liable for unlawful harassment whenever the harasser is of a sufficiently high rank to fall “within that class . . . who may be treated as the organization’s proxy.” In such circumstances, the official’s unlawful harassment is imputed automatically to the employer. Thus the employer cannot raise the affirmative defense, even if the harassment did not result in a tangible employment action.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:970}}</p>\r\r<h3>Officials Who Qualify as “Alter Egos” or “Proxies”</h3>\r\r<p>The Court, in <i>Faragher</i>, cited the following examples of officials whose harassment could be imputed automatically to the employer:</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-yellow">\r<ul>\r<li>President\r<li>Owner\r<li>Partner\r<li>Corporate officer\r</ul></div>', 23, 110, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(719, 'oc0300.2_24', '<h2>Personal Liability/Accountability</h2>\r\r<p>Employees and managers who harass their coworkers can be personally liable for their wrongdoing. They may face civil claims (for assault, battery, emotional distress, etc.) and criminal counts (for assault, battery, lewd conduct, etc.). Some states have anti-discrimination laws that also allow individuals to be sued for sexual harassment, although the federal law, Title VII, does not.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:971}}</p>\r\r<p>Under federal law, there is no individual liability for any claims under Title VII; therefore, only the employer is liable under federal law. In <i>Miller v. Maxwell’s International</i>, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that supervisors and employees are not personally liable for violations of Title VII.</p>\r\r<h3>EEOC Gets Personal</h3>\r\r<p>Individual harassers can be found personally liable for any torts committed against the victim, including but not limited to infliction of emotional distress, defamation, invasion of privacy, assault and/or battery.</p> \r\r<p>In 2011, the EEOC settled with a Hilton hotel that was harassing Hispanic employees with offensive comments and ethnic slurs. Hilton agreed to pay $195,000 and provide remedial training to all hotel employees.</p>\r\r<p>Despite Hilton\'s concession to the typical settlement terms, the EEOC wasn\'t satisfied that it would change the conditions in the hotel\'s kitchen or the anti-harassment skills of its supervisor. Specifically, the EEOC was concerned that the harassing executive chef was not only in charge of the kitchen, but had also admitted his misconduct.</p>\r\r<p>So, to teach the wrongdoer a lesson, the EEOC included in the settlement a provision aimed at improving the chef\'s legal and behavioral education. Accordingly, the settlement required the hotel to ensure that the executive chef receives "personal anti-discrimination training."</p>\r\r<p>"Federal law clearly requires employers to take prompt remedial action when they learn of harassment," said EEOC lawyer John Hendrickson. " In this case, the EEOC was prepared to show that not only did multiple employees report the harassment, but also that the executive chef himself acknowledged doing it. That\'s not acceptable, and it\'s not legal."</p>\r\r<p>However, with "personal anti-discrimination training" the EEOC hopes the executive chef will now learn what is acceptable behavior as well as what the law requires and prohibits.</p>\r\r{% if state == "CA" %}\r<p>Under California law, both supervisory and non-supervisory employees are individually liable for sexual harassment. The FEHA specifically states that “any employee of an entity subject to FEHA is personally liable for their own unlawful sexual harassment.” The risk in suing the offending supervisor or coworker individually for sexual harassment is that the harasser may not be financially able to pay damages. It is typical to sue both the employer and the individual harasser if the facts of the case allow it. Suing both makes it is easier to collect from whichever party has insurance or the requisite funds to pay a settlement or judgment.</p>\r\r<p>Supervisors are also individually liable for aiding and abetting sexual harassment of an employee; a supervisor may aid and abet sexual harassment by becoming aware of the harassment and failing to take action to stop the harassment, as stated in <i>Matthews v. Superior Court</i>. Furthermore, liability for non-supervisory employees for aiding and abetting is uncertain because generally only supervisors are responsible for taking steps to avoid and to stop sexual harassment.</p>\r\r<p>California Government Code Section 12940(j)(3) states that coworkers can be held “personally liable for any harassment…perpetrated by the employee, regardless of whether the employer…knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.” As a result of the addition of this section to the FEHA, it is now clear that coworkers can be held liable for sexual harassment. This is true even in situations where the employer is <u>not</u> liable for the accused coworker’s conduct because it did not know or have reason to know of the conduct.</p>\r\r<p>California Labor Code Section 2802 also states that an employer must indemnify employees for all necessary expenditures or lawsuits incurred as a direct consequence of the discharge of the employee’s duties.</p>{% endif %}', 24, 150, 1, NULL, NULL),

In addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved person\'s identity.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:959}}</p>\r\r<p>The anti-discrimination laws give individuals a limited amount of time to file a charge of discrimination. In general, a charge of discrimination must be filed <i>within 180 calendar days</i> from the day the discrimination took place. The 180-calendar day filing deadline is extended to <i>300 calendar days</i> if a state or local agency enforces a law that prohibits employment discrimination on the same basis.</p>\r\r<p>Holidays and weekends are included in the calculation, although if the deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, individuals will have until the next business day. Figuring out how much time individuals have to file a charge is complicated. If individuals aren\'t sure how much time is left, they should contact one of the EEOC’s field offices as soon as possible so they can assess whether they still have time. Also, if more than one discriminatory event took place, the deadline usually applies to each event.</p> \r\r<div class="callout callout-green">\r<h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>\r\r<p>Let\'s say an individual was demoted and then fired a year later. The individual believes the employer based its decision to demote and fire the individual because of their sex, and the individual files a charge the day after their discharge. In this case, only their claim of discriminatory discharge is timely. In other words, the individual must have filed a charge challenging the demotion within 180/300 days from the day they were demoted. If they didn\'t, the EEOC would only investigate their discharge.</p></div>\r\r<p>There is one exception to this general rule and that is if the individual is alleging ongoing harassment. In harassment cases, individuals must file their charge <i>within 180 or 300 days of the last incident</i> of harassment, although the EEOC will look at all incidents of harassment when investigating the charge, even if the earlier incidents happened more than 180/300 days earlier.</p>', 25, 150, 1, NULL, NULL),
	(721, 'oc0300.2_26', '<h3>Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs) and Dual Filing</h3>\r\r<p>Many states, counties, cities, and towns have their own laws prohibiting discrimination, as well as agencies responsible for enforcing those laws. The EEOC calls these state and local agencies "Fair Employment Practices Agencies" (FEPAs). Usually the laws enforced by these agencies are similar to those enforced by the EEOC. In some cases, these agencies enforce laws that offer greater protection to workers, such as protection from discrimination because individuals are married or unmarried, have children or because of sexual orientation. There also may be different deadlines for filing a charge, different standards for determining protection by these laws, and different types of relief available to victims of discrimination.</p>\r\r<p align="center">{{COURSE_IMAGE:972}}</p>\r\r<h3>Who to File a Charge With</h3>\r\r<p>Individuals can file their charge with either the EEOC or with a FEPA. Please keep note that the EEOC only accepts claims for businesses that have <i>15 or more</i> employees, so filing with the FEPA may be a better and only choice for employees of smaller organizations.</p> \r\r<p>When an individual initially files with a FEPA that has a worksharing agreement with the EEOC, and the allegation is covered by a law enforced by the EEOC, the FEPA will dual file the charge with the EEOC (meaning the EEOC will receive a copy of the charge), but will usually retain the charge for processing. If the charge is initially filed with the EEOC and the charge is also covered by state or local law, the EEOC dual files the charge with the state or local FEPA (meaning the FEPA will receive a copy of the charge), but ordinarily retains the charge for processing.</p>\r\r<h3>Reviewing FEPA Decisions</h3>\r\r<p>If a FEPA has a contract with the EEOC, a Charging Party may request that the EEOC review the determination of the FEPA. The EEOC does not review decisions by non-contract FEPAs. The EEOC will conduct a review only if the request is submitted in writing <i>within 15 days</i> of receipt of the FEPA’s determination. If the EEOC receives the request for a review after the 15-day time frame, it will be considered untimely and the EEOC may <u>not</u> conduct a review. The request should also include the reason why the Charging Party is requesting the review (e.g., relevant witnesses not contacted, evidence not considered, or presence of new evidence).</p>\r\r<h2>Remedies For Employment Discrimination</h2>\r\r<p>Whenever discrimination is found, the goal of the law is to put the victim of discrimination in the same position (or nearly the same) that he or she would have been if the discrimination had never occurred. The types of relief will depend upon the discriminatory action and the effect it had on the victim. For example, if someone is not selected for a job or a promotion because of discrimination, the remedy may include placement in the job and/or back pay and benefits the person would have received. The employer also will be required to stop any discriminatory practices and take steps to prevent discrimination in the future. A victim of discrimination also may be able to recover attorney\'s fees, expert witness fees, and court costs.</p>\r\r<h3>Compensatory & Punitive Damages</h3>\r\r<p>Compensatory and punitive damages may be awarded in cases involving intentional discrimination based on a person\'s race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, disability, or genetic information. Compensatory damages pay victims for out-of-pocket expenses caused by the discrimination (such as costs associated with a job search or medical expenses) and compensate them for any emotional harm suffered (such as mental anguish, inconvenience, or loss of enjoyment of life).</p>\r\r<div class="callout callout-red">\r<h4>ALERT:</h4>\r\r<p>Punitive damages may be awarded to <i>punish</i> an employer who has committed an especially malicious or reckless act of discrimination.</p></div>', 26, 240, 1, NULL, NULL),
